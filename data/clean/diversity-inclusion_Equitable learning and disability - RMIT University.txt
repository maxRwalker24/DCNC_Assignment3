### Equitable Learning Services – How RMIT supports students
The Equitable Learning Services team (ELS team) supports and creates equal
opportunities for students with a disability, long-term illness and/or mental
health condition. We also support primary carers.
ELS works in partnership with students to create an Equitable Learning Plan.
Your plan is tailored to you, supports your needs and establishes how RMIT can
provide ongoing assistance so you can access and participate in your studies.
The ELS team can assist you to manage your Equitable Learning Plan.
We ensure that students are included in all aspects of university life and we
value students’ input to continuously improve our services.
> The ELS team have been super helpful in putting together my Equitable
> Learning Plan, sharing it with the relevant teachers, and continually
> assisting me during assignments to ensure that I can do my best.

### We’re committed to inclusivity
Equitable Learning Services values diverse perspectives, experiences, and
backgrounds and is affirming of identities that intersect lived experience of
disability. We are committed to offering inclusive, respectful, and safe
spaces both online and physically and we encourage everyone to bring their
whole selves to RMIT. [Learn more about RMIT's commitment to diversity and
inclusion](/about/our-values/diversity-and-inclusion).
#### The language of disability
RMIT acknowledges that language concerning identity continues to evolve. In
accordance with guidance provided by the Australian Network on Disability,
RMIT uses ‘person first’ language to describe people with disability, while
acknowledging many people with disability prefer to use identity-first
language. Identity-first language puts a person’s disability identity before
the person – for example, ‘disabled person’ or ‘Autistic’ – instead of ‘person
with autism’; ‘Deaf’ – instead of ‘person who is deaf’. Many prefer to use
identity-first language as they regard their disability as a key part of their
identity. They use identity-first language to show their connection to the
disability community, demonstrate disability pride and emphasise that it is
society that is disabling. Of course, when interacting directly with people or
describing them, we respect and use their preferred way of describing
