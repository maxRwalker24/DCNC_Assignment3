# Group work: Doing the work
Once you have built a strong foundation for group work by using the strategies
previously outlined, it's time to get down to work.
To meet the task requirements, group members will be busy with different
responsibilities at the same time. Focus on communicating and collaborating to
successfully manage yourselves and the task.
Let's explore some strategies you can use.
## Hold regular meetings
* Use an agenda to keep meetings focussed on the task.
* Actively contribute to discussions using inclusive and respectful language.
* Be open to different ideas and different perspectives.
* Ensure everyone has a say. Listen when others are speaking and encourage the quiet members to contribute.
* Check and measure progress against the timeline.
* Meetings are an opportunity for the group to reconnect, review progress, provide feedback and make any necessary changes.
## Give each other constructive feedback
* Give positive feedback to motivate and encourage team members. Always start with genuine, positive feedback: say what you appreciate about their work before offering critical feedback.
* Be sensitive to how others may respond to criticism. Be nice.
* Use the S.M.A.R.T. principles to focus your feedback on the task:
* **Specific:** Focus on actual examples of the work or performance. General or vague statements are unhelpful.
* **Motivating:** Give reasons to continue or change behaviour. Why is it important or useful?
* **Action-oriented:** Align actions with the task requirements. If a change is required, what needs to happen?
* **Realistic:** Is the change something that the person can do? Do they need help? Who is going to help them?
* **Timely:** Provide feedback when it is requested or required. Waiting until the end of the task may affect everyone in the group and could allow a small problem to escalate.
## Deal with challenging behaviours and conflict
* Identify and acknowledge any conflict or dissatisfaction early. Disagreements arise when members lack clear directions or feel their knowledge and skills are ignored or criticised.
* Communicate any problems to the whole group and try to resolve the problem quickly, as a group. You will need to negotiate and compromise.

A pyramid with three levels. They are:
1. **Frustration:** "Why won't they listen to me?"
2. **Unclear responsibilities:** "Am I supposed to do this? I don't know what I have to do."
3. **Poor planning:** "What do I do next? Are we working together? Separately?"
### Manage group dynamics
Groups are made up of people with different expectations. For example, some
students are happy just to pass while others aim for high marks.
Sometimes these differences can cause tension. This is normal – all groups
experience highs and lows when working on complex projects over a period of
Do you recognise any of these people and their behaviours and attitudes in
* **Team player:** Collaborative, communicative, committed.
* **Hitchhiker:** Along for the ride, does minimal work but shares the results.
* **Superhero:** Comes to the rescue by taking over every task. A group of one!
* **Zombie:** Unengaged and unmotivated. May disappear for weeks or completely.
You are always going to encounter diversity within groups. The best way to
ensure an effective group work experience is to develop a strong process with

is unable to agree on a solution.
## Managing the task
### Use agendas in meetings
* Use the agenda as a checklist to ensure that all the task criteria have been met.
* Record decisions for actions, roles and responsibilities to provide clear direction to group members.
* Measure agenda actions against the timeline to help the team stay on track. Be prepared to adjust the timeline as the project progresses.
### Manage tasks and resources
* Organise information so that it is shareable and accessible to everyone. There are many online collaborative tools and apps to choose from. Remember to keep it simple!
* Create the final product. Your final submission may have specific requirements. Delegate responsibilities among group members for completing the work. Follow the strategies for [Wrapping up](/university-essentials/group-work/wrapping/).
