### RMIT promotes equality and inclusion for staff and students who identify
RMIT promotes equity and inclusion for LGBTIQA+ staff and students including,
but not limited to, those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
intersex, queer or questioning, and asexual.
This work is guided by RMIT’s Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access (IDEA)
Framework, which was developed in consultation and partnership with our
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and asexual (LGBTIQA+)
student and staff community members both within RMIT, and within the broader
RMIT’s LGBTIQA+ Working Group is responsible for guiding and contributing to
the implementation of the IDEA Framework, and comprises senior leaders, key
stakeholders and those with lived experience, both students and staff. If you
want to contact a member of the LGBTIQA+ Working Group, join the LGBTIQA+
Staff Network, talk to a local RMIT Ally in your area or speak with a
Diversity and Inclusion Advisor, contact
[inclusion@rmit.edu.au](mailto:inclusion@rmit.edu.au) or [People

#### 3 Ways to be an Effective Rainbow Ally
**1\. Educate yourself and others**
Being an ally is not a title, it's a commitment. It’s an active process that
is based on the decisions we all make and the actions we take.
Continuing to learn about the history and challenges LGBTQIA+ communities face
is a good first step. To learn about student-specific resources, visit the
LGBTIQA+ Students page.
Being genuine in your intention, action, and contribution is the difference
between true allyship and what others may feel is tokenistic support. Action
can take the form of calling out unsupportive behaviours of others or even
your own and maintaining the commitment to check in with friends, family or
When offering support in this way it is important to listen, empathise and
validate. You never know how much someone may need to talk about their
experience and what good this could do for both their physical and mental
**3\. Mindful Behaviours**
It’s important to understand what acceptable and supportive behaviour is and
is not. This starts with accepting advice from LGBTQIA+ community members and
realigning future behaviour or language, keeping in mind inclusion and
diversity is something to be celebrated and embraced!
This could begin as simply checking in with someone on their chosen pronouns
or understanding etiquette around gender neutral amenities.
RMIT Staff can access further detail [here](https://www.rmit.edu.au/staff/ourrmit/news/latest-news/2023/may/di-idahobit), including learning and
development opportunities.
#### LGBTIQA+ Research Network
The LGBTIQA+ Research Network is run by and for research students and staff at
RMIT who identify as and/or conduct research with the LGBTIQA+ communities.
The Research Network is a safe space where we can express our identities and
discuss our work within a supportive community of scholars.
The Network runs monthly seminars as well as monthly social catch ups.
To join, contact Emily Gray:
[emily.gray@rmit.edu.au](mailto:emily.gray@rmit.edu.au)
#### All gender toilets
Across our Victorian campuses, there are a number of all gender and accessible
toilets that students can utilise.

## RMIT policies and procedures
### Policies and procedures
#### Gender Affirmation
RMIT is committed to supporting all students and staff to bring their whole
selves to study and work.
The RMIT Gender Affirmation Guide is a toolkit for students and staff who wish
to affirm their gender. It is also designed to help allies, managers and
student-facing staff to support their students and colleagues with guidance on
processes, templates and emails, and links to internal supports and external
organisations that can provide further assistance.
Download the [RMIT Gender Affirmation Guide

#### Supporting students to use a preferred or chosen name
We are committed to supporting our students to use a preferred or chosen name
at RMIT, recognising the significant impact this can have on mental health,
participation, success and retention.
For guidance please visit [Trans and Gender Diverse at
RMIT](/students/support-and-facilities/student-support/diverse-genders-sexesand-sexualities/trans-gender-diverse), or to discuss this further, please
contact [inclusion@rmit.edu.au](mailto:inclusion@rmit.edu.au).
#### RMIT Dress Code
Staff and students who identify as trans, gender diverse, non-binary or
another gender identity are free to dress in a manner that affirms their
gender identity. RMIT does not have a formal dress code and supports our
community to dress in attire that makes them comfortable, while allowing them
to the successfully engage with their work and/or studies. For any questions
related to appropriate dress at work, feel free to contact People Connect.

## External support services
We understand and acknowledge that individuals within the LGBTIQA+ community
face distinct challenges when seeking and participating in support services
such as counseling, and domestic and family violence support. We know that the
LGBTIQA+ community possesses unique requirements when it comes to these
supports, and frequently encounter discrimination within these support systems
which can significantly impact their health and support outcomes.
It is crucial to ensure that the LGBTIQA+ community has access to services
designed to cater to their specific needs. Below, we have provided a list of
external support services tailored to the LGBTIQA+ community, which can be
accessed in conjunction with the services available to RMIT staff.
