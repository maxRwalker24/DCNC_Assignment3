### RMIT University Library provides a positive, welcoming, and enriching
experience for all members of the community.
## Safe and inclusive spaces statement
We value diversity of perspective, experience, and background and are actively
committed to a culture of inclusion, safety and respect within our physical

* working toward addressing collection content that is deemed discriminatory or harmful in nature against marginalised groups, including but not limited to LGBTIQA+, people with disabilities, neurodivergent and indigenous people
* encouraging all staff to undertake diversity and inclusion training covering Reconciliation, LGBTIQA+ inclusion, Accessibility and Cultural Competence.
* using preferred names and pronouns
* all physical Library locations having disability access to student spaces
* aligning with the University’s Digital Accessibility Framework to ensure digital content creation is designed with accessibility, diversity and inclusion in mind.

## **Intellectual freedom and our collections, including University Archives**
RMIT University Library and University Archives aims to ensure that the terms
and conditions that apply to the use of its resources is consistent with the
University [Intellectual Freedom
Policy](https://policies.rmit.edu.au/document/view.php?id=56). We uphold the
rights and responsibilities of staff and students to exercise their freedom to
engage in research, education and scholarship in their chosen areas of study
The Library may acquire resources for the collection that could be considered
‘controversial’ in their format, publication or subject matter. These
resources are collected if there is a demonstrated learning, teaching or
research need for such items. Some of these resources document past practices
or representations that are no longer considered acceptable, and some
resources take a view point or make arguments that are contentious. These
resources are useful to researchers and educators who take a critical
perspective of them during academic discourse.
By providing access to these resources, **RMIT University does not endorse any
attitudes, behaviours or prejudices contained within them**.
## Contact us
