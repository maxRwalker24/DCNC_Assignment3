![Abstract artwork titled 'Sentient' by Hollie Johnson, features a complex
pattern of intersecting blue, green, and yellow lines over a white background
showing the journeys of life starting, finishing and intersecting. The
colouring of the line work illustrates the evolution of nature through many
First Nations stories: the sun, the giver of life \(yellow\), the creation of
land \(green\), and the sea \(blue\). Red and black concentric diamond and
semi-circle shapes symbolise men and women respectively, connecting them to
Ancestors who gave birth to them. The artwork is also a representation of RMIT
and the experience within our community, culture and
pathways.](https://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/images/sentient-holliejohnson.jpg)
