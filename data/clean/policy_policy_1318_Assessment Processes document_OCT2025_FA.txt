Assessment and assessment flexibility policy.
Assessment – general processes
Design of assessment
Exams and assessment tasks must be materially different from any assessment task in the course in
previous teaching periods across locations (over a two-year period) unless restricted by requirements
for specific competencies for reasons of accreditation or safety. Please refer to College (and discipline)
standards for specific requirements.
— 12 credit point course, the total number of assessment tasks should not exceed 4, and in any
— 24 credit point course, the total number of assessment tasks should not exceed 6
except where progressive assessment involves more regular submission of contributions to a single
assessment piece (refer to section 1.8.2).
The total number of assessment tasks does not include those in micro-credentials.
The proportion of multiple choice answer assessments should not exceed 20% of the weighting of
assessment tasks towards the final course grade.
For higher education programs, the weighting of an individual piece of assessment within a course will
be no greater than 50% of the total marks except where the course is a research, studio-based,
capstone or WIL component of the program.
1.5. Other than where prescribed by a nationally accredited training package or state accredited courses
using competency-based assessment, a course can only include hurdle assessments where they are
required by safety or professional accreditation, registration or licensing requirements and they must be
clearly identified in the course guide.
The requirements specified in sections 1.1–1.3 are currently in transition and will be fully in effect by
Assessment information in course guides
1.7. See the course guides section of the program and course processes for:
— assessment information that must be provided in course guides
— conditions under which assessment in a course can be changed after the course offering has started.
The instructions for each assessment must provide students with clear and detailed advice of the
criteria by which their performance will be assessed.
1.8.1. RMIT is transitioning to a requirement that, where an assessment is graded and contributes
20% or more of the total course mark, a criterion-referenced assessment tool (rubric) or an
alternative rubric required for external accreditation will state the standards of performance
expected at each grade level: see the Using rubrics web page.
An assessment may comprise several separate tasks or parts, such as lab reports (where
students are required to do a report per lab), each of which is worth a minimal mark. In such
cases, where each part builds on the same material/concepts, the tasks or parts will be
added together and considered as a single assessment for the purposes of determining the
total number of assessment tasks in a course (see section 1.2) or the percentage an
assessment contributes to the total course mark (see section 1.4).
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 1
The requirement that assessment criteria take the form of a rubric:
— does not apply to multiple choice answer assessments
— is encouraged for final examinations but will not be enforced.
Students undertaking competency-based, non-weighted vocational education assessments
should be provided with descriptive (rather than numeric) rubrics that give clear advice on
how assessment decisions are made.
The requirements specified in section 1.8 are in transition in semester 1, 2019 to ensure that
these practices are fully embedded in all courses by semester 2, 2019.
1.9 Where exceptional educational or operational circumstances can be demonstrated, the course
coordinator may seek the approval of the College Deputy Vice-Chancellor (or nominee) for exemption
from the requirements detailed in sections 1.1–1.5 and 1.8.1–1.8.4.
Vocational education assessment
1.10. For processes to ensure that assessment in vocational education complies with regulatory
and funding requirements, see the vocational education webpage (VE Essentials) or contact
vocational.education@rmit.edu.au.
Group assessment work
Overview of group assessment work
1.11. Group assessment work (‘group work’) assesses the process as well as the product of working in
groups: it enables students to develop communication, cooperation and teamwork skills such as
planning, management, conflict resolution and peer support.
1.12. Group work is inclusive and accessible: it enables full participation by students from diverse
backgrounds and with diverse abilities.
1.13. Academic/teaching staff are actively involved in supporting group work throughout the group work
process to provide feedback, support skill development, assess the process and identify any group
process issues as they emerge.
Designing group work
In designing group work, staff will have regard to the following aspirational principles:
— is aligned with course learning outcomes and delivery mode
— reflects collaborative work in the relevant industry or profession
— is aligned with assessment and learning outcomes for the program as a whole.
1.15. Where a program includes group work in several core courses, these are designed to extend students
by building their collaborative skills progressively.
If, in courses with competency-based assessment, students undertake assessment tasks as a group,
each student will, where possible, be assessed individually on each component of the task.
1.17. Group work is designed to ensure that staff:
— manage group formation to ensure diversity and inclusiveness as far as possible
— inform students of how they are expected to contribute to group work
— where students may be new to group work, teach them intercultural and collaborative group work
skills including the use of collaboration tools
— where students may be new to group work and the course is taught face to face, allocate time for
group work in classes
— provide opportunities for students to reflect on the group process and their contribution
— provide feedback to students during the group work process to enable them to improve their skills
— can provide equivalent assessment tasks where students are prevented from participating in part of
the group work process by a disability, long-term physical or mental health condition, or short-term
circumstances outside their control.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 1
Managing group conflict
1.18. Staff provide:
— clearly defined processes for managing group conflict at the start of the group work
— guidance and active monitoring throughout the group work process so staff can intervene if a
group becomes dysfunctional.
1.19. Students who experience problems with group functioning are responsible for informing the relevant
staff as soon as possible so these issues can be addressed promptly and the group achieves its tasks.
Assessing group work
1.20. Staff provide students with:
— a clear statement of how their group work will be assessed, including marking criteria for and mark
proportions allocated to the group process and the outcomes
— instructions on how group members verify/authorise the submitted work
— feedback on group work assessment process and outcomes.
Submission of assessment work
1.21. The course coordinator ensures at the start of each teaching period that:
the part B course guide states how students will submit assessment tasks, and
1.21.2. staff teaching the course inform students how they will submit assessment tasks.
1.22. Electronic submission (eSubmission) is the preferred method for students to submit assessment work.
Physical submission should only be used for assessment work that cannot easily be submitted
electronically, such as creative works or physical artefacts.
1.22.1. The electronic authorisation of assessment website describes how staff must set up
eSubmission for students.
1.22.2. Students eSubmitting work must do so from their RMIT student account.
1.22.3. When eSubmitting work, students are directed to the Assessment declaration web page, and
must ‘click through’ this page, thereby declaring their authorship of the work. They don’t
need to include a cover sheet declaring their authorship.
1.23. Where students submit physical work for assessment, they must complete, sign and attach a cover
sheet that includes a statement of their authorship of the work.
1.24. A generic cover sheet for physical submission of assessment work is available from the student
assessment forms web page.
Submission of assessment for research component courses of 24 credit points or more
1.25. Sections 1.25–1.35 of these processes apply to research component courses of 24 credit points or
more in bachelor honours or masters by coursework programs, including where a 24 credit point
research component is broken into two 12 credit point courses.
1.26. The following two sections state two different sets of requirements:
— for submission and assessment of theses or dissertations for research component courses of
48 credit points or more (including where the thesis/dissertation is broken into two courses that
total at least 48 credit points): see sections 1.28–1.31, and
— for creative or professional practice research projects: see sections 1.32–1.35.
1.27. The requirements of sections 1.25–1.35 don’t apply to a research component course weighted at less
than 24 credit points and which isn’t part of a larger research component weighted at 24 credit points.
Submission of theses and dissertations for courses of 48 credit points or more
1.28. When a student believes their dissertation, thesis or project is ready to be submitted, they should
discuss with the supervisor whether the supervisor agrees that it is ready to be submitted.
1.28.1. The supervisor confirms the outcome of that discussion by email to the student within five
1.28.2. The student may choose to submit without consulting the supervisor or even if the supervisor
does not agree that the thesis/project is ready, but should note that unsupported submission
risks a poorer mark.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 1
1.29. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students must submit the thesis or dissertation by the
deadline stated in the information on assessment in the course.
1.30. Where, however, the student requires an extension to the deadline for submission of the thesis/dissertation:
1.30.1. because of unforeseen personal or health circumstances outside the student’s control, the
student should apply for an extension or special consideration: see sections 4.1–4.10 below.
1.30.2. because of unexpected and exceptional difficulties other than unforeseen personal or health
circumstances, such as difficulty accessing equipment or facilities, or delays in providing
supervision, the program manager or course coordinator has discretion to grant an extension.
1.31. Approved late submission may mean that the student’s final results are not approved in time for the
following round of higher degree by research scholarship applications.
Submission of creative or professional practice projects of 24 credit points or more
1.32. Schools/industry clusters should as far as possible schedule research component assessments to
ensure that the results are approved in time for graduates to compete in the next round of scholarships
to undertake a higher degree by research or to start employment in their profession after the end of the
relevant teaching period.
In Melbourne programs this means that results should as far as possible be approved in
October or at latest by late November.
1.33. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students must submit the assessment tasks in creative/
professional practice research component courses by the deadline stated in the information on
assessment in the course.
1.34. Where, however, the student requires an extension to the deadline for submission of the research
1.34.1. because of unforeseen personal or health circumstances outside the student’s control, the
student should apply for an extension or special consideration: see sections 4.1–4.10 below.
1.34.2. because of unexpected and exceptional difficulties other than unforeseen personal or health
circumstances, such as difficulty accessing equipment or facilities, or delays in providing
supervision, the program manager or course coordinator has discretion to grant an extension.
1.35. Approved late submission may mean that the student’s final results are not approved in time for the
following round of higher degree by research scholarship applications.
Supervision of research components in coursework programs
1.36 These processes do not apply to courses in HDR programs, or research methods and research
planning courses in coursework programs.
1.37 Research components in coursework programs may take the form of independent research or project
work or practice-related learning or an equivalent piece of scholarship.
1.38 These processes are intended to ensure that students receive adequate supervision in what may be
their first experience of undertaking a substantial research activity.
1.39 Refer to the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research and the RMIT Human Research
Ethics Procedure for guidelines on research conduct.
1.40 Refer to the Assessment and assessment flexibility policy and to other relevant parts of these
Assessment processes for information on research assessment.
1.41 For one year stand-alone bachelor honours programs that require a dissertation or thesis weighted at
48 credit points or more, the school or college may appoint an honours program committee.
1.42 The honours program committee is responsible for:
1.42.1 monitoring the allocation of supervisors and examiners to honours research components
serving as the course assessment committee for honours research components
serving as the program assessment board for the relevant honours programs.
1.43 The program will define in the course guide a normal word length for the dissertation/thesis appropriate
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 1
1.44 To be the principal supervisor for or to examine the dissertation or thesis, a person must possess
expertise in the relevant discipline area and:
for supervision or examination for an honours degree, a master degree or doctorate, or hold
equivalent standing and experience in industry or
for supervision or examination for a master degree, a doctorate.
1.45 For each student a principal supervisor of their dissertation/thesis is appointed who is an RMIT staff
member. The school must make every effort to ensure that the principal supervisor will be present to
provide the student with adequate supervision during the research component course. One or more
co-supervisors may be appointed who may be other RMIT staff or external to the University.
In exceptional circumstances, a school is required to engage industry practitioners in a sessional
capacity to act as primary supervisors for dissertation or thesis for master by coursework programs.
Where this occurs, industry practitioners must be available to provide the same level of support
required by the clause above.
If the principal supervisor is absent for four weeks or more:
1.47.1 a co-supervisor who is an RMIT staff member may stand in as principal supervisor for the
period of absence or
the school will arrange an interim principal supervisor for the period of absence. The student
must be informed about the arrangement of an interim principal supervisor who is not already
a co-supervisor, and must be given an opportunity to raise concerns and/or suggest a
different supervisor. Where the fact that the supervisor will be absent is known well in
advance, the interim arrangement must be in place before the absence starts.
1.48 Supervisors are responsible for:
1.48.1 allocating the student sufficient time for adequate supervision during the course, and
agreeing with the student on a schedule of meetings
1.48.2 guiding the student on:
— the choice of research topic
— planning the research
— the relevant literature
— research methods and techniques
1.48.3 providing the student with feedback on work in progress and suggestions for improvement
within a reasonable time-frame
informing the student where the student’s progress is too slow or the standard of their work
is inadequate and suggesting ways to address these problems. Such concerns should
initially be discussed with the student and then stated in an email which should be retained in
Ownership and retention of work submitted for assessment
1.49. For requirements in relation to student ownership of ideas the student produces for assessment tasks,
see the intellectual property policy.
Items submitted by students for assessment tasks remain the property of the student.
1.50.1. Where, however, in the opinion of the dean/head of school/associate director, the University
has contributed significantly to the cost of materials or resources to produce the item, the
school/industry cluster may require the student to reimburse the University or transfer the
ownership to the University.
Items submitted by a student for an assessment task remain in the University or under the control of
the university until the assessment has been marked.
1.51.1. They may, however, be reproduced, communicated to others (including external examiners),
compared and archived for the purpose of detecting plagiarism.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 1
Feedback on assessment work
1.52 Timely feedback effects the University’s commitment to transparent and supportive assessment and
supports students by:
— informing students of how they can improve prior to the census date and during the course
— demonstrating how performance has been measured against task requirements and course
1.53. Assessors are expected to provide students with marks and feedback on in-course assessment work
in time for students to improve their performance in related assessment tasks later in the course.
1.53.1. Assessors normally provide marks and feedback on in-course assessment tasks within
10 working days of the deadline for submission of the assessment work or, if a student is granted
an extension, within 10 working days of the date when the student submitted the work.
1.53.2. Assessors normally provide students with marks for all in-course assessments before
students sit any end-of-course exam.
Responding to student disclosures of unlawful or harmful behaviour
1.54 During engagement with assessment processes such as special consideration, equitable learning plan,
academic progress and appeals, a student may choose to disclose details of concerning, threatening
or inappropriate behaviour. Disclosures may include, but are not limited to, sexual harassment as
described in the Sexual Harassment Policy, sexual assault, stalking, self-harm, bullying, harassment,
unlawful discrimination and/or victimisation.
Safer Community provides support and advice to students and staff concerned about concerning,
threatening or inappropriate behaviour. Staff should contact Safer Community for initial advice while
maintaining student privacy. Such action will enable staff to respond to the student, providing timely
referral to relevant services such as Safer Community, Student Counselling, Students Complaints, and
Student Support. Mandatory reporting and other requirements, including Reportable Conduct Scheme
apply to students under the age of 18.
Where there is an immediate risk of harm, seek urgent assistance via:
— Emergency services 000
— RMIT Urgent Security
— If unsure and needing advice, contact the RMIT Staff line for urgent student support on 9925 1111.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 1
Assessment – examinations processes
The rules in these sections on examinations (exams) (sections 2.1–2.24) apply to all formal supervised
exams, whether managed centrally by the Academic Registrar’s Group (ARG) or managed by schools,
colleges or other units of the University.
These rules are written in terms of centrally managed exams of at least two hours duration,
but should also be applied as far as possible to other, school-managed exams.
These rules apply to exams conducted in RMIT programs delivered with partner institutions,
unless the partnership contract states other rules for exams.
Preparation for final exams
Examination development and coordination.
2.2.1 The course coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the final end of teaching period
examination papers and marking scheme are developed and made available in accordance
with prescribed requirements.
Development of the examination papers must be carried out in liaison with the course
management team, normally no later than the expiry of 50% of the teaching period.
2.2.3 Where a course is delivered in more than one location (including campuses and partnerships
outside Australia) consultation will occur with those responsible for delivery and assessment
at each location to:
— invite input into the development, moderation and proofing of the examination and
— coordinate the timetabling for preparation of the examination and marking scheme, and
the delivery, marking and moderation of the examination.
Preparation of back-up examination papers.
Three examination papers must be available for each course, one of which is for use where a
deferred exam sitting becomes required either via special consideration or where a breach in
the integrity of the first assessment occurs, necessitating a further sitting.
The second examination paper must be prepared at the same time as the original
— Where there are two standard teaching periods in the calendar year and a third paper is
not prepared at the same time as the original and second examination papers, the course
coordinator must ensure that appropriate staff are available to prepare a timely third
paper, where it is required.
In the case where any additional exam papers are not used, they may form the basis of the
papers for the following teaching period offering of the course, where appropriate.
Examination timetabling arrangements.
The course coordinator will ensure that time frames are identified for the end-to-end
processes for examination development, finalisation, approval, and inclusion in the University
examination timetables.
This information will be communicated to the Associate Director, Integrity and Assessment
Support, ARG (to enable timetabling and creation of the exam Online Header and Coversheet
generator) and the appropriate School/College office (as directed by the respective School/
College responsible for the course/s).
RMIT University | Assessment Processes
2.4.3 Where the examination timetable is not managed by ARG, Melbourne (for example, school
run examinations and those conducted at campuses and partnerships outside Australia), the
delegated office responsible for timetabling will implement local procedures that meet the same
standards of probity and integrity as those of the ARG Integrity.
Integrity of examination handling processes.
Only University-approved secure file transfer processes will be utilised to maintain integrity of
end-to-end examination development and delivery.
Drafts must not be exchanged via email, USB, in hard copy or other non-approved
processes. Within a local academic unit, however, staff may use RMIT online collaboration
software to share drafts of the paper.
Review of exam papers.
The course coordinator will ensure that one or more exam reviewers are appointed who will
be responsible for checking the content coverage, technical accuracy and academic validity
of the examination questions and the marking scheme.
To maximise the scope for review, wherever possible, the reviewer should not have been
involved in the original preparation of the examination paper.
The exam reviewers must have expertise in the discipline area and will ensure the papers
meet each of the following criteria:
— Appropriate coverage of course content
— Compliance with description of exam in course guide
— Weighting of marks appropriate to topics covered in course
— Appropriate time allocation
— Set at a standard consistent with the level of the course
— Sufficiently challenging
— Of appropriate length
— Internationalised/contextualised
— Cultural and gender acceptability
— Technical accuracy
— Instructions are clear and unambiguous
— Special items (e.g. tables, figures, appendices) are specified, attached and labelled
— Marks are consistent with any relevant instructions.
The examination reviewer discusses any proposed amendments to the exam paper with the
course coordinator (or that person’s delegate) who will decide the matter.
2.6.5 When the review process is complete the examination paper is made available (via the secure
file transfer system) to the proof reader.
Proof reading exam papers.
The course coordinator will appoint one or more proof reader/s to ensure clarity of questions
and instructions and the overall quality of presentation.
The officer responsible for proof reading should have expertise in document design, editing
The proof reader reviews the paper/s to ensure:
— Instructions are clear and easy to follow
— Time and date of the exam are correct
— Reading time is clearly stated
— Each question and each part is on one page only (i.e. do not split across a page boundary)
— Special items (e.g. tables, figures, appendices) specified are attached and accurately labelled
— Figures, diagrams, formulae clearly legible
— A profession level of presentation is achieved
— Grammatical correctness
— Pages are numbered and in sequence, ensuring that proper page breaks are used
(i.e., Ctrl and Enter, not via multiple cursor entries)
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 2
— Marks for each question and each part are shown clearly
— Marks add up to the correct total
— Marks are consistent with any relevant instructions.
2.7.4 Where a course is delivered in more than one location (including campuses and partnerships
outside Australia) the proof reader will ensure that those with delegated responsibility for
delivery and assessment at each location have had the opportunity for input into the proofing
The proof reader must report any errors found in an exam paper to the course coordinator
to arrange for the corrections to be actioned via the secure file transfer system.
2.7.6 When proof reading is complete, the exam paper, header sheet and cover sheet for each
course are converted directly into a single PDF document to ensure a high image quality
(papers must not be printed and scanned).
The proof reader will transfer the document/s via the secure file transfer system to the course
coordinator, accompanied by a declaration that they have been proofed, which shall be
retained by the school in an auditable manner. The format for file transfer should be PDF to
retain formatting integrity. However, wherever reasonably possible an editable copy (MS
Word, or other suitable format) should be accessible to facilitate an equitable assessment
arrangement for students with a learning disability, where requested.
The course coordinator, reviewer, and proof reader may be the same person, provided they
meet the eligibility criteria set out above.
Final check of exam paper and marking scheme by course coordinator.
Once the course coordinator receives the examination papers from the proof reader, a final
The course coordinator will check to ensure:
— Figures, diagrams, formulae are clearly legible
— Professional-level presentation
— Pages are numbered and in sequence
— Marks add up to the correct total
— The marking scheme is complete and consistent with the examination paper.
2.8.3 Where a course is delivered in more than one location (including campuses and partnerships
outside Australia) the course coordinator will ensure that those with delegated responsibility
for delivery and assessment at each location have had the opportunity to provide input into
the final check and have confirmed the version control of the final paper.
The course coordinator is responsible for the final sign-off of exam papers and marking
schemes. An auditable record of the satisfactory completion of proofing and final checking
will be established and retained by the school.
Once this sign-off has been obtained the following processes are implemented:
— Where the examination is timetabled by ARG Integrity, exam header sheets and cover
sheets are created using the Online Header Sheet and Cover Sheet Generator, available
via the Exams – staff web page.
— Where the examination timetable is not managed by the ARG (Melbourne), the delegated
office responsible for timetabling will implement local procedures that meet the same
standards of probity and integrity as those of ARG Integrity.
Printing of examination paper.
Printing of examination papers and creation of exam header sheets and coversheets:
— Where the examination is timetabled by the ARG Integrity, final examination papers with
the exam header sheet and coversheet are to be forwarded ARG Integrity by the published
deadline to the scheduled date of the examination via the secure file transfer system.
— Where the examination is not timetabled by the ARG (Melbourne), the delegated office
responsible for coordinating the printing of the examination paper, header and coversheets
will implement local procedures that meet the same standards of probity and integrity as
those of the ARG Integrity.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 2
— Papers to be transferred globally should be finalised by no later than the expiry of 70% of
the teaching period.
— Papers to be used local to the print source should be finalised no later than the expiry of
80% of the teaching period.
2.10. The official examination period following each period of study is published in the annual academic
calendar. The timing of school-run examinations is determined by the school.
2.10.1. Standard examination sessions normally commence at the following times:
— Morning sessions: 9.15am
— Afternoon sessions: 1.45pm
2.11 ARG Integrity set the exam timetable for each teaching period, before formal exams are held, in
consultation with colleges and schools.
2.11.1 Exam timetables are published to students on the students’ web pages.
2.11.2 Once the exam timetable has been published, it will only be changed:
— for significant, unavoidable reasons,
— where the relevant Deputy Pro Vice-Chancellor, Learning and Teaching has endorsed the
change in writing, and
— the Academic Registrar (or nominee) has approved it.
2.11.3 As far as possible exams are scheduled to allow a one hour and 15 minutes break between
2.11.4 Students are responsible for checking when their exam will start in the published central
exam timetable or with the school in the case of school-managed exams.
2.11.5 Students who require adjustments to their exam conditions because of a disability or
long-term physical or mental health condition must register with Equitable Learning Services
by the deadline stated in the relevant academic calendar.
2.11.6 The Academic Registrar and/or schools may arrange for deferred, supplementary and other
exams to be held when necessary outside the published exam period or in addition to
school-managed exams notified to students. Where such ad hoc exams are held, the area
managing them will inform students of their exam date, time and venue at least five working
days before the exam.
2.11.7 Students must bring their valid RMIT student card to the examination venue and clearly
display it on their examination desk.
2.11.8 Students are permitted to take a hard copy bilingual dictionary into an examination unless
otherwise stated on the examination cover sheet. The dictionary must not contain any
notations or be otherwise tampered with in any way. The dictionary must be presented to
the examination invigilator for inspection at the venue prior to the examination.
Electronic dictionaries are not permitted unless otherwise stated on the exam coversheet.
2.11.9 Where reading time applies, students will be given 15 minutes reading time at the start of the
examination session.
2.11.10 Students are not permitted to write in the examination script books, mark in any way any
of the examination materials, read any text other than the examination paper or do any
calculations during reading time.
2.11.11 Where a student has two or more exams scheduled at the same time it is their responsibility to:
— check their student email account regularly before the commencement of the examination
period to ascertain arrangements for clash exams, and
— report to the Clash Examination Venue to sit the examinations as advised.
2.11.12 Students should arrive at the examination venue no less than 20 minutes before the published
commencement time of the examination.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 2
2.11.13 Where the examination is of two hours duration or more, students will be allowed to enter the
examination venue up to 60 minutes after the published commencement time of the examination.
No additional time will be granted, however. Students who arrive more than 60 minutes after
the published start time will not be permitted to enter the examination room and will receive
a zero mark for that assessment.
2.11.14 Students will not normally be permitted to leave the examination room within the first 60 minutes
from the published commencement time of the examination.
2.11.15 Students will not be permitted to re-enter the examination venue after leaving it, unless they
have been under approved supervision during the period of leave.
2.11.16 Students will not normally be permitted to leave the examination venue during the last 15 minutes
2.12. Everyone who enters an exam venue is subject to the authority of the exam supervisors.
2.13. See the Exams – staff web page for detailed instructions for exam supervisors.
Student responsibilities in relation to exams
2.14. Students attending exams must comply with all directions given by exam supervisors, set out on the
exam paper or displayed in the exam venue.
2.15. Students who become unwell during the examination and are unable to complete the assessment
must report their illness to the exam supervisor and leave the venue. These students may apply for
special consideration, with supporting medical documentation, seeking a further opportunity to sit the
examination. Effective Term 1/Semester 1 2019.
2.16 Students who either complete the examination or leave the venue before completion and do not report
their illness to the exam supervisor, will be ineligible to apply for special consideration to re-sit the
examination. Effective Term 1/Semester 1 2019.
2.17. For detailed instructions on student responsibilities in relation to exams, including advice on materials
that students can and can’t take into exams, behavioural expectations, and requirements in relation to
emergency evacuations of exam venues, see the Assessment web page.
Incidents of misconduct during an exam
2.18. Academic and general misconduct are defined in the Student conduct policy.
2.19. Student misconduct during an exam will be dealt with in accordance with the student conduct policy
and Student conduct policy process.
2.20. The senior exam supervisor is authorised to suspend a student who disrupts an exam session, requiring
them to leave the venue and not return that day.
Responsibilities of examiners
2.21. See the Exams – staff web page for detailed instructions for examiners.
Retention of marked exam scripts
2.22. The school retains marked exam script books for at least 12 months after final results for the course
offering are posted.
2.23. After 12 months, exam script books are disposed of via the normal RMIT Retention and Disposal
Authority, except where sample copies of exam scripts may be need to be retained for purposes of
program accreditation.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 2
Exams for students who are elite athletes
2.24. Students who are classified as elite athletes by RMIT Sports, and whose athletic commitments prevent
them from attending an exam at the exam venue, can apply to RMIT Sports for a remote supervision
2.24.1. RMIT Sports will transmit the request to ARG Integrity.
2.24.2. Remote supervised exams take place on the same date and at the same time as the exam
for other students in the course offering.
Examination of theses and dissertations for courses
of 48 credit points or more
2.25. Dissertations and theses are examined as follows.
2.25.1 The principal supervisor proposes two examiners. To avoid a conflict of interest, neither of the
examiners can have supervised the student’s dissertation or thesis work.
2.25.2 The college deputy pro vice-chancellor, learning and teaching can approve an exception to the
rule in the previous sub-clause where the school demonstrates exceptional circumstances.
2.25.3 The examiners are approved by the program manager or research component course
coordinator and notified to the program assessment board.
2.25.4 The program manager provides the examiners with the instructions to students for
undertaking the dissertation or thesis and the criteria for assessment. The program manager
also provides a link to the Supervision of research components in coursework programs
process (see sections 1.36–1.48).
2.25.5 The examiners provide written reports including a short statement of the reasons for the mark
awarded, and a statement to be provided to the student. They’re expected to return these
reports and statements within two weeks of receiving the dissertation or thesis for examination.
2.25.6 Students are provided with the examiners’ statements, but not the marks awarded by the
2.25.7 Where the two examiners’ marks differ by more than 15% of the maximum possible total
mark, the dean/head of school or nominee will appoint a third examiner, who may be from
within the University or external to it, but who must not have supervised the dissertation or
thesis. They must be provided with the same materials for the examination as were the two
original examiners, but not with the original examiners’ reports.
2.25.8 The examiners’ reports and marks are referred to the course assessment committee for
determination of a final grade.
2.26. Assessment of theses or dissertations should as far as possible be scheduled to ensure that the
results are approved in time for graduates to compete in the next round of scholarships to undertake
a higher degree by research or to start employment in their profession after the end of the relevant
In Melbourne programs this means that results should as far as possible be approved in
October or at latest by late November.
2.26.2. Students should note that this time-frame may need to be extended where a third examiner
is required under section 2.25.7 above, or for other reasons.
2.27. Students are entitled to appeal against the result of an honours research component course by the
appeal process set out in the review and appeals sections below: see sections 7.1–7.16.
Examination of creative or professional practice projects
of 24 credit points or more
2.28. Major assessment tasks (weighted at 50% or more of the mark in an individual course) are assessed
by more than one assessor. At least one of the assessors must have the level of qualification required
for assessment in the program: see program and course processes for details.
2.29. Other assessment tasks (weighted at less than 50% of the weighting of a single course) are assessed by
more than one assessor, except where there are practical reasons why they can only be assessed by one
staff member. At least one of the assessors of any assessment task must have the level of qualification
required to assess in the program: see program and course processes for details.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 2
Assessment – quality processes
Course assessment committees
3.1. Course assessment committees (CACs) review and approve results for courses. This involves:
ensuring results are entered by the results entry deadline in the relevant academic calendar,
or as instructed by ARG Integrity; or recording the reasons for any missing or interim results.
3.1.2. monitoring grade distribution and course outcome statistics.
3.1.3. monitoring reports of changes to grades after results publication.
overseeing moderation to ensure equivalence and comparability of assessment across
multiple locations or delivery channels and over time.
granting supplementary assessments under the circumstances stated in sections
approving final grades for students in the course (other than final grades that are the result
of administrative processes).
allocating course-based prizes, awards and commendations.
3.2. CACs are not required to be held for VCE or VCAL courses, or research courses in HDR programs.
3.3. CACs must be held for:
— vocational education courses and
— higher education coursework courses including coursework courses in HDR programs and
Schools, industry clusters and colleges have flexibility to organise their CACs to ensure
efficiency and a rigorous approach: a CAC meeting may deal with multiple courses across
multiple programs as needed: in some schools/industry clusters it may be possible to hold
a single CAC for all coursework courses.
In schools/industry clusters with more than one discipline it may be best to hold a CAC for
the courses offered in each discipline.
The CAC meets at the end of each teaching period, after marking has taken place and when course
results are being decided.
The members of a CAC are:
— the deputy dean/head of school/associate director, learning and teaching/associate dean, discipline,
where programs are led across a whole college rather than a school, the program director can chair
— staff responsible for course management/coordination
— staff responsible for marking and grading assessment.
In the case of vocational education courses the program team may act as the committee,
with the program manager/leader as chair.
3.6. A quorum of a meeting of the CAC is the chair, at least one member of staff responsible for management/
coordination of the course, and at least one marker/grader from each location where the course is
RMIT University | Assessment Processes
3.7. See the CAC minute template webpage and the CAC report in Business Objects. The school, industry
cluster or college ensures that the CAC minutes record:
— the date, time and venue of the meeting, or the fact that it was held online and the time during
— the courses (including teaching period and delivery location) that were considered by the meeting
— attendance and a confirmation that the meeting is quorate
— the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting
— discussion of reports of changes to published grades since the previous meeting
— any individual results added or changed at the meeting, and the reasons for this
— in extraordinary circumstances, where results are missing, an explanation for this
(appropriate interim results should have been entered)
— confirmation that grading clearly aligns with the published assessment criteria
— the reasons why any results remain as interim grades
— any supplementary assessments granted (the SUP interim grade must be entered for these)
— for any narrow fail grades (with mark 45–49%), a confirmation that these have been re-marked
by a second assessor and remain fails
— any scaling of results arising from moderation, and the reasons for these (if scaling has already been
done by the course management team, it should still be reported to the CAC and noted in the minutes)
— a summary of any discussion of grade distributions and enhancements to assessment in the course(s)
— the allocation of any course-based prizes, awards or commendations
— at the end of the meeting and after any other changes, approval of all final grades in the course(s).
3.8. A CAC may grant a supplementary assessment opportunity to a student where the student has:
— failed to demonstrate competency in an assessment in a competency-based vocational education
program which requires that students be given further opportunities to demonstrate competency
(in these cases the supplementary assessment must be granted within 10 working days after the
— attempted all assessments for the course but, in extraordinary circumstances, it is not possible for
the course assessment committee to determine whether the student has achieved a pass (50%), or
— achieved an overall mark of 50% or more in a course but failed one hurdle assessment and the
course is a prerequisite to core courses in the next teaching period or year of the program or is
part of a clustered group of competencies in a vocational education program.
3.9. A chair of a CAC may grant a supplementary assessment opportunity in a course for which the CAC
is responsible, as an outcome of a review of assessment under section 7.7 below.
3.10. See sections 6.26–6.32 below for the processes for holding supplementary assessments and
recording results for them.
3.11. Where a CAC fails to meet as required or meets but is inquorate the dean/head of school/associate
director will assume the responsibilities of the committee and make the decisions it would normally make.
3.12. The findings and recommendations of the CAC are provided to:
— program assessment boards for programs in which students in the course offering are enrolled, and
— reviewers of the course or of programs in which the course is part of the program structure.
3.12.1. Where a coursework course is part of an HDR program, the CAC findings and recommendations
are provided to the school HDR coordinator, for monitoring of the academic progress of
students in the program.
Program assessment boards
3.13. The functions of program assessment boards (PABs) are:
— to consider ‘show cause’ submissions from any students who are required to show cause for
reasons of established unsatisfactory academic progress (final stage): see sections 6.1–6.21 below
for more detail about the academic progress process
— to approve allocation of program-level prizes and awards
— to consider recommendations from course assessment committees in relation to student or
program cohort performance
— to consider how assessment is working in the program and whether enhancements are needed.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 3
3.13.1. Professional staff perform the following administrative tasks on behalf of the PAB on
(in competency-based vocational education programs) on behalf of the program team:
— review the grades achieved and academic progress of each student in the program in
each teaching period
— check for students who are eligible to graduate and identify award level classifications
— identify students who are at risk of unsatisfactory academic performance (first stage)
and nominate an academic advisor to develop an academic performance improvement
plan with the student (or without the student if they choose not to participate)
— identify students with established unsatisfactory academic progress (final stage) and ask
the student to show cause why they should not be excluded from the program
— arrange supplementary assessments for students in the circumstances set out in section
See sections 6.1–6.21 below for more detail about the academic progress process.
3.13.2. Schools, industry clusters and colleges have discretion to hold PABs to perform this
administrative work if the program team prefers to do this themselves, but are not required
3.14. A PAB must be held for higher education course work programs and vocational education programs.
3.14.1. Schools, industry clusters and colleges have flexibility to organise their PABs to ensure
efficiency: a PAB meeting may deal with multiple programs as needed: in some schools/
industry clusters it may be possible to hold a single PAB for all coursework programs.
3.15. PABs meet after CAC and before course results have been published in each teaching period.
3.15.1. A PAB may need to meet again to hear show cause submissions from students who have
been classified as at risk (final stage).
3.16. The members of a PAB are:
— the deputy dean/head of school/associate director, learning and teaching or deputy dean/head
of school for the relevant discipline or associate dean, discipline or discipline leader (chair); where
programs are led across a whole college rather than a school, the program director can chair
— the program manager or nominee for each program considered by the PAB
— year level or core course coordinators
— representatives of other schools with which a double degree program is shared or that service-teach
core courses in the program.
3.16.1. Where a PAB is held for a vocational education program, the program team may constitute
the PAB membership, and the program manager may chair.
3.17. A quorum of a meeting of the PAB is the chair and two members from any other membership category.
3.18. See the PAB minute template webpage and the PAB report in Business Objects. The school, industry
cluster or college ensures that the PAB keeps minutes that record:
— the date, time and venue of the meeting, or the fact that it was held online and the time during
— programs (including teaching period and delivery location) that were considered by the meeting
— attendance and a confirmation that the meeting is quorate
— award levels of graduands
— supplementary assessments granted
— allocation of any program-level prizes, awards and commendations
— discussion of minutes of course assessment committees for the teaching period and possible
improvements to assessment in the program
— the outcomes of student show cause submissions (whether the PAB allowed the student to
continue in the program with an at risk classification, or decided to recommend to the dean/head
of school that the student be excluded from the program)
— note all students who have been identified for first stage at risk or final stage at risk
3.19. The minutes of the PAB are provided to reviewers of the program(s) for which the PAB is held.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 3
3.20. The chair of a program assessment board (PAB) may ask the school/industry cluster that manages
a course to grant a supplementary assessment opportunity to a student where:
— the student is enrolled in a higher education program with a total credit points requirement of
96 credit points or more, and
— the student has passed all other courses required for the program but has narrowly failed (with
a mark of 45–49%) a course in what would have been their final teaching period to complete their
— the student is enrolled in the second-to-last semester or trimester before they are expected to
complete their program and has narrowly failed (with a mark of 45–49%) a core course, and this
course isn’t available in the final teaching period in which the student is expected to complete
3.21. See sections 6.24–6.32 below for the processes for holding supplementary assessments and
recording results for them.
Moderation of assessment
3.22. See the course assessment committees (CACs) section of these processes (sections 3.1–3.12 above)
for the responsibilities of the CAC, including moderation.
3.23. Moderation of assessment can result in adjustment of student marks to overcome differences in the
difficulty of assessments and/or severity of marking.
3.23.1. Wherever possible such adjustments must be made before the marks for the assessment
are communicated to students.
3.23.2. The reasons for each adjustment are minuted by the CAC that approved it.
3.24. The course coordinator is responsible for consistency and transparency in moderation of assessment
3.25. Moderation of marking of an assessment involves the following steps:
3.25.1. The course coordinator specifies the marking scheme for the assessment in writing.
3.25.2. All markers agree on a marking process that promotes consistency, such as using one marker
for a question across the whole course, double-marking where a marker is new to the course,
and regular communication between markers during the marking work.
3.25.3. Where there’s only one marker, a moderator is assigned.
3.25.4. The course assessment committee (see sections 3.1–3.12 above) then:
— reviews the distribution of marks across the course
— makes any adjustments to marks and
— identifies improvements for future assessments and marking.
3.25.5. Where moderation identifies significant variations between different markers, the course
coordinator takes action to increase consistency, such as clarifying the marking scheme,
cross-marking, consensus techniques or review of marking by others.
3.25.6. The course coordinator provides a summary report on moderation in the course for the
course assessment committee, setting out:
— the moderation processes used
— any issues that arose in moderation
— reasons for adjustments made to marks, and
— any other matter relevant to the CAC’s approval of final results in the course.
3.25.7. At least once a year each school/industry cluster will collect samples of marked examinations
and major assessment tasks, in each grade-band of results, from each location where each
course is offered (including online offerings) for review by staff responsible for course and
assessment design in the school.
3.25.8. The school/industry cluster uses this review to evaluate the program assessment strategy.
3.25.9. Records of this review are retained and provided to program reviews as evidence of quality
assurance and continuous improvement of assessment in the program.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 3
Validation of assessment
3.26. This section applies to validation of assessment in higher education coursework programs.
3.27. For processes to ensure that validation of assessment in vocational education complies with regulatory
and funding requirements, see the Program Quality and Review web page.
3.28. Validation of assessment involves ensuring that assessment in programs and courses:
— provides clear information and instructions to students, so they understand how they’ll be assessed
and what outcomes are expected of them
— is consistent across all program/course locations and modes of delivery, including partnered delivery
— is designed to ensure integrity and minimise academic misconduct
— as far as possible, realistically assesses students’ skills for the relevant industry or profession
— in courses, assesses the course learning outcomes
— across programs, achieves alignment of course learning outcomes with program learning
outcomes, so that all program learning outcomes are adequately assessed
— does not unnecessarily duplicate assessment tasks or over-assess learning outcomes
— progressively assesses more advanced knowledge and skills as students reach higher levels
— provides diversity of assessment tasks across the program
— provides as much flexibility as possible for students with diverse learning needs, and
— involves the relevant industry or profession in design of assessment.
3.29. Validation activities may include:
— program team meetings to review assessment methods and tasks
— nomination of a lead assessor to manage validation of assessment
— review of assessment in the program by an external panel
— statistical comparison of assessment results between locations, channels and over time
— benchmarking of assessment with other educational institutions
— obtaining student feedback on assessment via facilitated discussions or student-staff consultative
3.30. Each program team documents its validation activities and keeps records, which are provided for
program review, so the program can demonstrate ongoing quality assurance and improvement of
Academic integrity and academic misconduct
3.31. The academic integrity web page explains academic integrity to students and sets out their
responsibilities for this.
3.32. See sections 1.21–1.35 above for requirements for submission of assessment work including
declarations of authorship and correct referencing.
3.33. The Academic Integrity policy sets out the responsibilities of program managers and staff for fostering
and ensuring academic integrity.
3.34. Where assessment (in coursework or higher degree by research programs) involves research with
human participants, their information or their tissue, or animal subjects, this must be conducted
ethically and have ethics approval.
3.34.1. See the Research policy for requirements for ethical conduct of research, and ethics approval
3.35. Program managers are responsible for ensuring that academic integrity is explained to students
entering the program.
3.36. Where a student fails to acknowledge their sources, and this may be because they don’t yet understand
correct referencing practice, course coordinators are required to:
— explain that this is a breach of academic integrity
— require the student to repeat the assessment task and/or deduct marks from the assessment
(up to a maximum of 20% of the mark for the assessment), and
— warn the student by email that if they fail to acknowledge their sources again, this will be handled
as an allegation of academic misconduct and may result in more severe penalties
— forward the email to the academic services team for the program so they can keep a list of students
who have received such warnings.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 3
3.37. Where a student fails to acknowledge their sources for a second time, or cheats on an assessment
task, the course coordinator refers this to a senior officer as an allegation of academic misconduct.
3.37.1. The Student conduct policy defines academic misconduct and how allegations of academic
misconduct are handled.
3.37.2. The Student conduct policy process sets out the process for senior officers to hear allegations
of academic misconduct or refer more serious allegations of academic misconduct to the
Student Conduct Board.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 3
Assessment – flexibility processes
Extensions of time to submit assessment work
4.1. See section 5.2 of the assessment and assessment flexibility policy for the time-frame
for requests for extensions.
4.2. See the extensions of time to submit assessment work web page for the application process.
Special consideration
4.3. See section 5.3 of the assessment and assessment flexibility policy for:
— the grounds on which special consideration is available
— the time-frame within which students must apply for special consideration and
— possible outcomes of special consideration applications.
Possible outcomes of special consideration don’t include
— raising a student’s grade for an assessment for which they’ve already received a grade, or
— transferring the weighting of an assessment to another assessment.
4.4. See the special consideration web page for the process for applying for special consideration and
detailed requirements in relation to this process.
Applications for special consideration are treated confidentially and only outcomes of the
application are shared with staff outside the ARG: see the special consideration web page
for a detailed confidentiality statement.
The Academic Registrar may submit an application for special consideration on behalf of a
student where a doctor certifies that the student is incapable of submitting the application
Applications for special consideration must be accompanied by supporting documentation.
Where documentation is in a language other than English, the student must provide an
English translation by a NAATI accredited translator.
Student disclosures of concerning, threatening or inappropriate behaviour are to be managed
in accordance with Assessment – general processes, section 1.54).
4.5. Circumstances that may meet the grounds for special consideration include (but aren’t restricted to):
— physical or mental illness
— carer responsibility for a member of the student’s immediate family
— an unexpected, unavoidable employment commitment
— bereavement of an immediate family member or someone else close to the student
— having been the victim of a serious crime
— an unexpected, unavoidable religious, cultural or family commitment.
Circumstances such as not being fully vaccinated, providing a valid exemption, or failing to provide a
vaccination status to the University are not grounds for special consideration.
For a student to be eligible for late course withdrawal without academic penalty, they must
demonstrate that their circumstances have:
— had an impact for so much of the teaching period that it wasn’t practicable for them to
fulfil course requirements, or
— prevented them from completing substantial assessments despite adjustments that have
been granted, so that they’ll fail the course unless a late withdrawal is granted.
RMIT University | Assessment Processes
4.5.2. Where a student:
— provides supporting documentation stating that the student is incapacitated for study
for a substantial part of the teaching period, or
— applies for a further deferment of a substantial assessment task for which they have
already been granted repeated deferments
the Academic Registrar or their nominee may grant the student late course withdrawal
without academic penalty if it is the only reasonable outcome.
In instances where a student is seeking special consideration for the same examination for a third time,
where eligibility has been established, the granted special consideration outcome will be restricted to
‘Late Course Withdrawal Without Academic Penalty’ only, refer special consideration web page. No
fourth opportunity will be provided for the student to complete the examination. Students may apply
for removal of financial liability through available remission processes. Effective Term 1/Semester 1 2019.
4.7. Applications for special consideration cannot be accepted from students who have either completed
the examination or left the venue before completion and do not report their illness to the exam supervisor.
Applications in these circumstances will be deemed to be ineligible and will be automatically withdrawn
by the university. No appeal opportunity is provided. Effective Term 1/Semester 1 2019.
4.8. Students can’t appeal the cancellation of their special consideration application because it is late,
incomplete or because they haven’t provided supporting documentation within five days of submitting
the application or within five days of being requested to provide supporting documentation.
Students may, however, request a review of such a cancellation: see the special
consideration web page for the review process.
4.9. Where an application for special consideration is denied, the outcome communication refers the
student to information about the appeal process.
4.10. Students may appeal the outcome of a special consideration application where special consideration
is denied: see sections 7.23–7.27 for the appeal grounds and process.
Deferred assessments
4.11. A deferred assessment is the opportunity to sit or re-sit an assessment activity at a later date where
4.12. A deferred assessment tests the same areas of skill and depth of knowledge as the original assessment.
If a student is granted a deferred assessment, the University will notify them of the date, time and
venue, by email to their RMIT University student email account, at least five working days before the
deferred assessment date.
4.14 When a deferred assessment is granted, the course result is recorded by the Academic Registrar’s
Group as DEF (deferred assessment) until the result of the deferred assessment is recorded. School/
industry cluster staff may only replace a DEF result with the result of the deferred assessment once this
It is the student’s responsibility to:
4.15.1. check their student email account daily for notification of a deferred assessment
4.15.2. comply with any instructions in the notification that they have been granted a deferred
4.15.3. ensure that they are available to sit the deferred assessment, at the time and place specified
in the notification.
4.16. Deferred assessments must be held by the end of the first week of the following term/semester, where
If the student does not sit the deferred assessment, and no further special consideration is granted,
they will receive a mark of zero for the assessment task.
4.18. The school/industry cluster that offers the course will calculate the student’s overall result in the course
based on their result for the deferred assessment.
4.19. The school/industry cluster will record the student’s final grade in the course before the deadline for
adding or dropping courses in the next term/semester of study, where possible.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 4
Equitable learning plan
4.20. See section 5.4 of the assessment and assessment flexibility policy for the purpose of equitable
assessment arrangements (EAAs) and what adjustments these may provide.
4.21. Students may register with Equitable Learning Services (ELS) and be assessed for an equitable
learning plan (ELP), including an EAA, where they:
— have a disability and/or long-term physical and/or mental health condition, or
— have primary carer responsibility for someone with a disability and/or long-term physical and/or
mental health condition.
4.21.1. To register with ELS, students follow the process set out on the ELS web page.
4.21.2. To ensure they can be assessed and receive any adjustments in time, students are advised
to apply to ELS to register at least four weeks before the first assessment task for which
they’ll need adjustments.
4.21.3. Once a student is registered with ELS, ELS consult the student and, where necessary,
college and school/industry cluster teaching and academic services staff, to reach agreement
on appropriate alternative assessment adjustments (see section 4.26).
4.21.4. Student disclosures of concerning, threatening or inappropriate behaviour are to be managed
in accordance with Assessment – general processes, section 1.54).
4.22. Where a student has an EAA, the program manager of the program in which the student is enrolled
is responsible for ensuring all course coordinators are aware of the EAA and the types of adjustment
4.22.1. The academic services team that supports the program should
— help the program manager fulfil this responsibility, and
— provide a generic email account to receive individual ELPs from ELS.
4.23. Students who have an EAA are expected to:
— communicate regularly with lecturers, teachers and assessors to ensure that the EAA is implemented
— respond promptly to communications from staff requesting information in relation to their EAA
— notify ELS promptly – and at latest within 10 working days – of any change in their condition that may
require reassessment of their needs. (Students with an immediate need for additional adjustments
should apply for special consideration in the interim, and provide supporting documentation from
their treating health practitioner.)
4.24. Students with a non-permanent or variable health condition and students who have primary carer
responsibilities must register with ELS at the start of each academic year to review their condition
and discuss how well their ELP is meeting their needs.
4.24.1. The ELS may, however, approve an ELP to cover more than one academic year and waive
the requirement for the student to reregister annually, where the student’s disability or health
condition is permanent and unvarying.
4.25. Where a student registers with ELS but isn’t granted an EAA, the ELS emails the student notifying
them of the reasons for this decision and advising the student of the appeal process: see sections
7.28–7.30 below for review and appeals in relation to EAAs.
Alternative assessment arrangements
4.26. The ELS, program staff and students arrange alternative assessment arrangements (AAAs) under an
ELP by the following process.
4.26.1. AAAs must be appropriate to the student’s needs, but can’t compromise the academic
integrity of the course/program.
4.26.2. Establishing this balance can be complex, so there must be consultation between the student,
the program manager and relevant course coordinators to determine the best AAAs.
4.26.3. Students should be encouraged to register with the ELS before the first teaching period or as
early in the teaching period as possible.
4.26.4. Once a student has registered with the ELS and the ELS has issued their ELP, an ELS staff
member will notify the program manager and/or course coordinator that the school/industry
cluster needs to meet the student to discuss AAAs.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 4
4.26.5. ELS disability advisors are available for the student and staff to consult about AAAs and how
to handle discussing them, and a disability advisor may attend the meeting if requested.
If the program hasn’t already defined and published its inherent requirements, the program
team should meet before the meeting with the student, to define the program inherent
requirements and consider what AAAs can reasonably be provided to the student.
4.26.7. The meeting(s) with the student should consider the following points:
— What are the essential learning outcomes for the course and/or program, and what
learning outcomes are optional?
— What abilities/knowledge/skills must the student demonstrate to complete the course
and/or program successfully?
— Does the course/program include requirements of an external registration authority such
as the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency or Victorian Institute of Teaching?
If so, how do these professional registration requirements contribute to the discussion of
learning outcomes and how these must be demonstrated?
— Are the learning activities and assessment tasks the only way that the required abilities/
knowledge/skills can be acquired or demonstrated?
— Whether any AAA applies only to courses in which the student is currently enrolled,
or can apply to other courses in the program in which they will enrol subsequently.
If the meeting agrees on AAAs, program staff should document the agreed AAA and the
rationale for it, and the program manager should authorise the document (either by signing
and dating it or electronically by an email stating approval).
4.26.9. The program manager or academic services team then sends the AAA document to the
disability advisor, the student and course coordinators of courses in which the student is
4.26.10. If the AAA can be used in subsequent courses, the program manager or academic services
team provides the AAA to course coordinators of these courses when the student enrols in
them, along with the notification of the student’s ELP.
4.26.11. If, however, the meeting doesn’t agree on AAAs, the program manager sets out in a memo:
— the inherent requirements of the course and/or program and why these require the
relevant learning activities and assessment tasks
— why the requested AAAs aren’t appropriate
— why any preferred assessment tasks are necessary to demonstrate learning outcomes.
4.26.12. The program manager endorses this memo and sends it to the Manager, ELS for approval.
4.26.13. If the Manager, ELS approves the memo, it becomes a formal statement of the University’s
position that the requested AAAs cannot be provided.
4.26.14. Where AAAs can’t be provided, the program should as soon as possible provide academic
counselling to the student to advise them on other more suitable study options.
4.26.15. If the student isn’t satisfied with the denial of AAAs, they may be able to appeal it: see sections
Assessment arrangements for elite athletes
4.27. RMIT University is a signatory to the Elite Athlete Friendly Universities agreement, and under this
agreement provides reasonable flexibility to enable students who are elite athletes to maintain their
academic progress while fulfilling their elite sporting commitments.
4.28. Only students who have been identified as elite athletes by the RMIT Sports team can be granted an
elite sporting assessment arrangement (ESAA).
4.29. An ESAA authorises schools or colleges in whose courses the student is enrolled to adjust assessments
where the student’s elite sporting commitments conflict with their preparations for an assessment task
or an assessment activity.
4.30. To be eligible for a specific adjustment the student must provide supporting documentation to the
school/industry cluster or college detailing the sporting commitment and its dates.
4.30.1. The documentation must be an original or certified copy of a letter from the elite sporting
organisation, on the organisation’s letterhead.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 4
4.31. A school/industry cluster or college may provide one or more of the following adjustments to a student
who has an approved ESAA:
— support where the student is unable to attend classes, such as notes, recordings, online lecture
materials or occasional one-on-one catch-up sessions with academic staff (to be initiated by the
— an extension to the original deadline of an assessment task, which can be greater than seven
calendar days (for any further extension for the same assessment task, however, the student
must apply for special consideration)
— extra time to complete a presentation or flexibility in the timing of the presentation
— extra time to submit gradable components of a tutorial, practical, laboratory or online activity
— equivalent assessments in place of group work assessments, where the student’s absence to
fulfil elite sporting commitments prevents them from participating in the group work.
4.32. The following types of assessment adjustment can’t be provided under an ESAA: students must
apply for special consideration to get these types of adjustment:
— deferment of a test or exam
— adjustments to participation in a work integrated learning placement or internship.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 4
Assessment – management of results
This section applies to:
— results for RMIT accredited courses
— results for vocational education courses
— results for coursework components of higher degree by research (HDR) programs.
It doesn’t apply to the process for results for research components of HDR programs, but
the grading tables under this section specify the grades that can be used for these courses.
It doesn’t apply to externally assessed courses undertaken as part of the Victorian Certificate
of Education or Victorian Certificate of Adult Learning.
Types of grade and their approval for use
5.2. See the student results grade tables for:
— the grades that can be used for the various types of program and course at RMIT,
— rules for their use, and
— the expiry period of interim grades.
The Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education and Vice President approves the schedules of final and interim
grades that can be used at RMIT University.
Final grades appear on the student’s transcript of results as a record of the student’s overall
performance in assessment tasks for a course.
Interim grades are used to record temporary statuses of the student’s course result up to the
point where a final grade is determined.
Interim grades are valid for a specified period, after which the interim grade may be converted
to a default fail result.
The Academic Registrar determines the period after which an interim grade applied to a
student’s record will be converted to a default fail result
After the specified period of validity of an interim grade has elapsed, if no final result has been
recorded for the course enrolment by that time, the Academic Registrar’s Group will convert
the interim grade to a default fail grade of (as appropriate) NN (Fail), EFG (External fail grade)
or DNS (Did not submit for assessment).
5.4. Administrative grades are approved for use by the Academic Registrar.
Administrative grades are used where students are not to receive a final grade for administrative
reasons: for example to record withdrawal after the course census date or remission of fees
under special circumstances).
Two grading systems are used at RMIT:
— ungraded assessment (for vocational education courses this is the competency-based grading
Result publication dates
5.6. Students are entitled to final course results by the result publication date as published in the relevant
academic calendar or set by ARG Integrity. See the Results Processing Online webpage for full
RMIT University | Assessment Processes
Exceptions to this rule are where:
— a process under another university regulation or policy bars the student from receiving
— where a student has been granted an extension of the assessment deadline, deferment
of the assessment task or an equivalent assessment with a later deadline or date of
performance of the task, so that the final result isn’t available by the result publication date.
The learning management system may be used to provide students with results of their
in-course assessments, which may suggest a provisional overall mark in the course: however,
the final overall mark for the course may differ from the provisional overall mark because of
moderation, special consideration or other adjustments to assessment, correction of errors,
review of result, or as the outcome of a student conduct or appeal hearing.
Management of final student results
5.7. See sections 3.1–3.12 above for course assessment committees’ responsibility for deciding and
approving final student results in courses.
5.8. Schools/industry clusters/colleges approve results and enter them into Results Processing Online
(RPO) by the deadline in the relevant academic calendar, to ensure results are ready to be published
by the result publication date.
For flexible delivery courses, however, schools/colleges set the result release date when
scheduling the class: this date must be within 28 calendar days after the course end-date.
5.9. Where the course uses graded assessment the school/industry cluster/college records an overall
numeric mark for each student result, except under the following circumstances:
5.9.1. where the student has gained a mark of 50% or more in a course but has failed the course
because they failed a mandatory hurdle assessment: in this case the school/industry cluster/
college enters an NH fail grade with no numeric mark; or
5.9.2. where the student has passed a course after being granted a supplementary assessment, in
which case the school/industry cluster/college enters an SP final grade with no numeric mark
5.9.3. where a student has ceased engagement in a vocational education course, in which case
the industry cluster/college enters an SEC final grade with no numeric mark.
5.10. Student results are released by the Academic Registrar on or after the result publication date for the
teaching period. See the RPO calendar containing result release dates on the Results Processing
Changes to published results
5.11. Schools/industry cluster/colleges may change published grades for one of the following reasons,
where the student has not yet had their award conferred.
5.11.1. Special consideration was granted and the final result has been determined.
5.11.2. An error in the original result has been found, so that the result needs to be changed.
5.11.3. An appeal outcome determined this grade change (appeals to the College Appeals
Committee or University Appeals Committee).
5.11.4. An interim grade (not a special consideration interim grade) is being replaced with a final result.
5.11.5. A blank result is being replaced with a final result (other than an RPL pending or SEC – these
have their own separate reasons – see below).
5.11.6. A fail result (where an interim grade was converted to a fail) is being replaced with a final result.
5.11.7. A supplementary assessment was granted and a final result has been determined (SP or NN).
5.11.8. An SEC grade is being added or changed back to a blank grade (vocational education
5.11.9. An RPL interim grade (RNY) is being added or replaced with a final RPL grade (vocational
education courses only).
5.11.10. EXTL – An exchange course transcript has been received and a pass EPG or fail EPG grade
5.11.11. A&T – An apprenticeship and traineeship student has now completed and needs to have the
graded date changed to reflect this.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 5
5.12. Where a graduate has had an award conferred, and the school, industry cluster or college finds that a
grade needs to be changed for a course that was part of the graduate’s enrolment for the award, the
school/industry cluster/college must email ARG Integrity (at assessmentsupport@rmit.edu.au) to request
the grade change. See section 3 of the Conferral and Graduation Procedure for full information.
5.13. ARG Integrity team may change published grades for one of the following reasons.
5.13.1. A student appeal or conduct decision determined the grade change.
5.13.2. An interim/blank result is being converted to a fail grade.
5.13.3. ARG conversion – results have now expired and are being converted to fail grades.
5.14. See the Changes to Grades webpage for full information. Staff change grades by the following process:
5.14.1. Authorised staff initiate (using the online grade change process):
— replacement of blank results or interim grades with a final result, or
— replacement of a final result with a different final result as a correction.
5.14.2. The school, industry cluster or college academic services team reviews and actions these
changes (using the online changes to grades process) on behalf of the chair of the relevant
course assessment committee.
5.14.3. The school, industry cluster or college academic services team may also initiate and approve
a grade change on behalf of a course coordinator where the updated result and evidence
has been provided by the course coordinator: in this case the course coordinator will receive
a notification of the grade change.
5.14.4. The online grade change process
— requires staff initiating changes to select a valid reason and, where appropriate, attach
supporting documentation of the reason for the change, and
— notifies students, by email to their RMIT student email account, on the next working day,
informing them that their grade has been changed and of the reason for the change.
5.14.5. The dean/head of school/associate director is responsible for ensuring that course
assessment committees review reports of changes to grades via the online process to:
— ensure integrity of assessment and
— minimise the numbers of results that are not yet final at the result publication date.
5.14.6. ARG Integrity, on behalf of the Academic Registrar, changes:
— blank results to final fail grades (also see the next clause), and
— interim grades to default final fail grades after the expiry period of the interim grades
5.14.7. Where a result remains blank by the date when ARG Integrity must convert it to a final grade,
ARG Integrity will convert it to the fail grade appropriate to the course.
5.15. The student administration management system (SAMS) calculates a grade point average of each
student’s marks in each program they undertake, to provide an overview of students’ level of
achievement in their program. This is not applicable to vocational education programs.
In some types of program, a student’s final grade point average in their completed program is used to
decide what level of award they’ll receive.
5.17. See the grade point average web page for full information on the way RMIT calculates and uses grade
Weighted average mark
5.18. For students who commenced their enrolment in a bachelor honours degree from 1 January 2016
onwards, the student administration management system (SAMS) calculates a weighted average mark
— all a student’s course marks in a one year honours program
— courses designated as to be used for this calculation in four year bachelor honours programs.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 5
In a small number of double degree programs, however – where both component degrees
are bachelor honours degrees – the student management systems can’t calculate the WAM
accurately. For these programs the academic services team:
— calculates the WAM manually and
— emails the Completions, Awards and Graduations unit in the Academic Registrar’s Group
(at awards@rmit.edu.au) asking them to override the system-calculated WAM with the
manually calculated WAM.
5.18.2. For students who commenced their enrolment in a bachelor honours degree before
1 January 2016, their award level is calculated on the basis of their grade point average in the
program: see the rescinded awarding degrees with honours or pass with distinction policy.
5.19. The student’s weighted average mark in their completed program decides the level of honours of their
bachelor honours award.
5.20. See the weighted average mark web page for full information on the way RMIT calculates and uses
weighted average marks.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 5
Assessment – academic progress processes
Academic progress (coursework programs)
This section sets out detailed rules for:
— monitoring the academic progress of students in coursework programs
— identifying students whose academic progress is unsatisfactory so they can be offered learning
support, resources and assistance
— where students continue to make unsatisfactory academic progress despite being offered support,
considering whether to exclude them from their program
Responsibilities of students and staff in relation to academic progress
6.2. Students are responsible for maintaining their academic progress.
6.2.1. Where a student is identified as having unsatisfactory academic performance, they’re
responsible for taking steps to improve their performance by:
— seeking advice from staff,
— participating in development and implementation of an academic performance
improvement plan, and
— using academic and other support services.
6.3. School, industry clusters and college staff are responsible for:
— providing a learning environment in which students are able to improve their academic performance
where it has been classified as unsatisfactory
— monitoring students’ engagement with learning and assessment, and performance in assessment,
— monitoring the academic progress of all students enrolled in coursework programs managed by
the school/industry cluster, at the end of each semester; or, where programs are delivered in more
or fewer than two standard teaching periods a year, at least every six months
— where students are classified as having unsatisfactory academic performance, providing an
academic intervention to develop an academic performance improvement plan.
For Victorian Certificate of Education programs, continuous feedback is provided via Canvas
for each Unit and students receive the formal statement of results and certificates from VCAA
(Victorian Curriculum Assessment Authority) at the end of the year
See also the responsibilities of program assessment boards in relation to academic progress
in section 6 of the assessment and assessment flexibility policy and sections 3.13–3.21 above.
The Academic Registrar’s Group is responsible for:
— reviewing recommendations from deans/heads of school/associate director to exclude students
from their program for sustained unsatisfactory academic performance, to ensure that the school,
industry cluster or college has carried out academic progress interventions and the show cause
process in accordance with these processes
— where the recommendations have arisen from correct processes, excluding students from their programs
— managing the process for appeals against academic progress exclusions, and supporting students
through this process.
Definition of unsatisfactory performance
The Deputy Vice-Chancellor Education and Vice President has approved the criteria for classifying
students as having unsatisfactory academic performance.
RMIT University | Assessment Processes
Approved correspondence templates and pro formas
6.6. Academic progress is a sensitive process, governed by external regulations, and open to external
review. Accordingly schools/industry clusters/colleges must use the approved academic progress
templates for communication with students.
Any modification to an academic progress template that school/industry cluster staff wish to
make must be approved by ARG Integrity (email: assessmentsupport@rmit.edu.au).
ARG Integrity reviews and updates the academic progress templates regularly in consultation
with colleges, schools, industry clusters and other stakeholders.
Identification of students with unsatisfactory academic progress
6.7. Within 10 working days of the release of results for the relevant teaching period, professional staff acting
on behalf of the chair of the program assessment board (PAB) identify all students in the program(s) for
which the PAB is responsible, who meet the criteria to be classified as having unsatisfactory academic
6.7.1. Where, however, a program is delivered in more or fewer than two standard teaching periods
per year, this identification of students must occur at least twice a year: for example:
— If a program is offered in three trimesters a year, it could occur after the first or second
trimester, and after the third trimester.
— If a program is offered in six teaching periods a year, it should occur after the third and
sixth teaching periods.
— Where vocational education courses are delivered over periods longer than half a year,
the program must at least twice a year provide and document an academic advice
intervention to students who are have failed assessment elements of the unit.
Schools/industry clusters/colleges have discretion to offer students academic advice
whenever they fail courses, without identifying them as having unsatisfactory academic
performance at that time.
The school/industry cluster/college will classify students who meet the unsatisfactory academic
progress criteria for the first time in the program as first stage at risk (of unsatisfactory academic
progress) in the program.
6.8.1. Where students:
— are undertaking closely related programs concurrently or in a sequence, or
— are undertaking an RMIT program and a program with a partner institution concurrently
under a partnership agreement, or
— have been enrolled in a replacement version of a program, or the same program with
a new award title, or a closely related program in the same discipline
these programs can be considered to be a single program for the purpose of classifying
students as at risk (first stage) or at risk (final stage).
6.9. Within 10 working days after release of results for the teaching period, school, industry cluster or
college academic services staff, on behalf of the PAB chair:
— inform students who are classified as first stage at risk of this fact, and
— invite the student to an academic advice interview or
— tell them how to request an academic advice interview.
For this notification, the school, industry cluster or college uses the approved academic
6.10. Schools/industry clusters have two options for this academic intervention with students classified as
first stage at risk.
6.10.1. Option 1 – create an academic performance improvement plan (APIP) and send it to the
student with an invitation to attend an academic advice interview, as follows.
— The academic services team emails to the student’s RMIT student email account the at
risk notification including a completed academic performance improvement plan (APIP).
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 6
— The communication offers the student the chance to attend an academic advice interview
to develop an APIP more tailored to their circumstances if they choose.
— The academic services team places the notification and APIP on the student file.
— If the student doesn’t request an academic advice interview within five working days
they’re considered to have accepted the APIP that was sent to them.
6.10.2. Option 2 – create the APIP at the time of the academic advice interview, as follows.
— The academic services team emails to the student’s RMIT student email account the at risk
notification and an invitation to attend an academic advice interview to develop an APIP.
— The academic advisor and student collaborate at the interview to develop the APIP.
— If the student doesn’t participate in the interview, the school/industry cluster subsequently
creates an APIP without input from the student and emails it to the student’s RMIT email
6.10.3. Option 1 or Option 2 (above) should normally be done at least five working days before the
last date to add courses in the next teaching period to provide students with an opportunity
to amend their enrolment where necessary, or where this is not possible, within the first four
weeks of the next teaching period.
— The academic services team places the notification and APIP on the student file.
6.10.4. The purpose of the academic advice interview is to give the student an opportunity to identify
personal and study factors impeding their academic performance and contribute to their APIP.
6.10.5 The APIP sets out the actions they should take to improve their academic performance, and
identifies relevant support services the student can use. The APIP should be an
unambiguous document that will act as:
—an action plan for the student; and,
—a clarification of the expectation of the University regarding the student’s progress
It must be designed to assist the student to complete their academic program within its
normal duration and should be tailored to the individual needs of the student. It must:
—clearly identify on what grounds the student has been deemed to be ‘at risk’
—be explicit in indicating/referring support services relevant to the student’s needs
—be explicit in advising students of any relevant policies/procedures
—notate the reasons provided by the student for their poor academic performance
(where provided); and
—notate any evidence provided by the student in support of any stated impact on their study
6.10.6 Where the program team believes that a student is struggling to fulfil the inherent
requirements of the program because of a disability or long-term physical or mental health
condition, the program manager or a senior school academic leader should hold the
academic advice interview. See sections 6.22–6.23 below for more information.
6.11. Where a student meets the criteria to be classified as having unacceptable academic performance
for a second time in the same program, they should be classified as at risk final stage (established
unacceptable academic performance).
6.11.1. The chair of the relevant program assessment board (or in a vocational education program,
the program manager) has discretion, however, not to classify a student as final stage at risk,
but to allow them to continue in the program at first stage at risk, if the student is close to
completing the program or where compassionate and compelling circumstances known to
the school/industry cluster exist.
6.11.2. The following types of students are never classified as at risk final stage:
— apprentices and trainees (whose academic progress is managed in accordance with
their training contract)
— local Victorian Certificate of Education and Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning students
(whose academic progress is managed in accordance with the procedures of the Victorian
Curriculum and Assessment Authority)
— fee-paying students in Open Universities Australia (OUA) programs delivered by RMIT
University (but students in commonwealth-supported places in OUA programs delivered
by RMIT may be classified as final stage at risk).
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 6
6.12. Where a student is classified as at risk final stage, the academic services team of the school, industry
cluster or college, on behalf of the program assessment board (PAB) chair, informs them of this fact
and invites them to show cause why they shouldn’t be excluded from their program.
6.12.1. The school, industry cluster or college emails this invitation to the student’s RMIT student email
account within 10 working days of publication of results for the relevant teaching period.
6.12.2. For this invitation the school, industry cluster or college uses the relevant template from the
approved academic progress templates.
6.12.3. The invitation gives the student 10 working days from the date on which the invitation is sent
to them to submit their show cause submission.
6.12.4. The school, industry cluster or college retains a copy of the show cause invitation on the
6.13. The student’s show cause submission should disclose the issues and circumstances that have impeded
their academic performance, and explain how the student intends to improve their academic performance.
6.13.1. As far as possible, the student should provide independent supporting documentation of the
relevant issues and circumstances.
6.13.2. Any supporting documentation should be in English or, if it is not in English, the student must
provide a translation into English by an accredited translator.
6.14. The PAB (or, in vocational education programs, the program team) then considers each student’s show
cause submission and decides whether to
— recommend to the dean/head of school/associate director that the student be excluded from the
— permit the student to continue in the program with a classification of at risk first stage.
6.14.1. The PAB makes the same decision in relation to students who have been invited to show
cause but who haven’t made a show cause submission.
In accordance with the timelines published for academic progress by the ARG, the PAB (or in vocational
education programs, the program team) must decide whether ‘final stage’ students who have been
invited to show cause have demonstrated cause to be permitted to remain in the program, or whether
to recommend exclusion to the Dean/Head of School/Associate Director. It isn’t mandatory to
recommend exclusion at this point, even if the student doesn’t make a show cause submission.
Exclusion has a significant impact on both the student and the University, so it is expected that the
PAB will be satisfied that documented and reasonable attempts have been made to gain the student’s
engagement during the period since academic difficulties were first identified.
In considering any show cause submission the PAB must:
— exercise academic judgement
— take account of the student’s overall performance in the program and any other relevant issues
— take into consideration any exceptional, individual, compassionate or compelling
circumstances experienced by the student that have impeded the student’s academic
performance, and which may have less of an impact in future (refer to the definition of
compassionate or compelling circumstances used in the DEEWR-DIAC course progress
— respond to student disclosures of concerning, threatening or inappropriate behaviour in
accordance with Assessment – general processes, section 1.54), and
— comply with the privacy principles and policy.
6.15.2 Other factors the PAB should consider include:
— whether the student is close to completing the program
— whether the student has shown signs of improving their performance since they were
previously classified as at risk, so that there’s a possibility they may improve further.
— the general principle that it isn’t in students’ interest to continue expending time and money
in studying a program where their academic progress continues to be unsatisfactory
— the University’s responsibility to exclude students where it seems unlikely that they will be
able to fulfil program requirements.
6.15.3 Where the PAB decides to allow a student to continue in their program the student must be
invited to attend a further meeting with an academic advisor and another APIP must be
completed and provided to the student (whether the student attends the meeting or not).
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 6
6.15.4 Where the PAB decides to recommend exclusion it must specify any conditions for acceptance
back into the program. Students wishing to apply for re-admission after the expiry of their
period of exclusion may apply via the standard competitive application process/es and their
previous academic performance must be taken into account in considering their application.
6.15.5 Where the PAB decides to recommend exclusion and the student submitted a timely show
cause submission, the PAB must provide a detailed response to the student which:
— directly addresses each of the circumstances, explanations and evidence the student
presented in their submission; and
— states the reason/s these were not sufficient to warrant continuation in the program.
6.15.6 Students have a right to know on what basis important decisions are made regarding their
entitlement to candidature.
6.16. Where the PAB (or in vocational education programs, the program team) permits a student to continue
in the program with a classification of at risk first stage, the school, industry cluster or college should
within 10 days of this decision inform the student of this fact and offer them an academic advice
interview, as for other students with this classification: follow the steps in sections 6.8–6.10 above.
6.17. Where the PAB (or in vocational education programs, the program team decides to recommend
exclusion of a student, the following process steps occur.
6.17.1. For each teaching period, the Academic Registrar sets a deadline by which schools/industry
clusters must recommend any exclusions for unsatisfactory academic progress.
6.17.2. Within five working days of the decision, the academic services team notifies the student
of this outcome by email to their student email account.
6.17.3. For this notification the school, industry cluster or college uses the relevant template from the
approved academic progress templates.
6.17.4. The PAB makes a recommendation to the dean/head of school/associate director,
recommending an exclusion period of 12 months, by the deadline for these recommendations
in the relevant academic progress timeline.
6.17.5. For this notification the school, industry cluster or college uses the relevant template from the
approved academic progress templates.
If the dean/head of school/associate director approves the recommendation, they or their
nominee notifies the Academic Registrar (at academicprogress@rmit.edu.au), by the deadline
in the relevant academic progress timeline, of the decision to exclude. This notification must
— a copy of the PAB exclusion recommendation including the reasons for the decision,
duration of the exclusion and any conditions for readmission to the program
— a copy of any APIPs
— copies of all correspondence relating to the student’s academic progress.
6.17.7. ARG Integrity reviews the exclusion notification to check that, in accordance with the rules
in this section of the assessment processes:
— the student has been kept informed of their academic progress status and decisions in
— academic interventions have been provided to the student, and
— the student has been offered an opportunity to show cause why they shouldn’t be excluded.
If ARG Integrity finds that the academic progress processes have been applied correctly, they
notify the student, by email to their student email account, of their exclusion and the
opportunity to appeal it.
6.17.9. The date this notification is sent is the date on which the exclusion will start if it isn’t overturned
on appeal. See sections 7.18–7.22 below for the processes for appeals against exclusion.
6.17.10. A student who has been notified of their exclusion must remain enrolled or on an approved
leave of absence; if enrolled, they can continue to attend classes until the end of the 20 working
days period in which they may appeal the decision and/or make an external complaint. If they
appeal or complain, they remain enrolled and can continue to attend classes until the outcome
of their appeal is known.
6.17.11. If the student doesn’t submit an appeal within 20 working days after the exclusion notification
is sent to them, ARG Integrity will arrange for the student’s enrolment to be cancelled.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 6
Effects of exclusion
6.18. A student who has been excluded is not a student of the university during their period of exclusion
unless they’re admitted to and enrol in another program.
6.19. The university reports the exclusion of students studying in Australia on a student visa to the Department
of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP), unless the exclusion is overturned on appeal or review.
The Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) National Code, under the ESOS Act 2000,
requires the university to report excluded students, to ensure that student visa requirements are not
6.20. A student who has been excluded from their program can’t be readmitted to the program for a period
of 12 months from the date on which the exclusion commenced (see section 6.17 above).
6.20.1. Readmission to the program isn’t automatic, but is subject to a selection decision, in the
same way that other applicants to the program may be selected for the offer of a place.
6.20.2. The selection officer should consider whether the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of
success in the program based on the results of their most relevant previous study, including
their previous performance in the program. (Also see sections 6.24–6.25 below.)
6.20.3. The applicant should include in their application any information and supporting documentation
to establish that they’ve improved their likelihood of maintaining satisfactory academic progress –
for example, showing that circumstances which impeded their academic performance are no
6.21. A student who has been excluded from a specific program may apply for admission to other RMIT
programs during their period of exclusion – unless they have also been expelled or had their enrolment
suspended as the result of other processes such as a student conduct process.
6.21.1. Admission to another program is not automatic, but is subject to a selection decision, in the
same way that other applicants to the program may be selected for the offer of a place.
6.21.2. The selection officer should consider whether the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of
success in the program based on the results of their most relevant previous study, including
their previous performance in the program from which they’ve been excluded.
6.21.3. The applicant should include in their application any information and supporting documentation
to establish that they’ve improved their likelihood of maintaining satisfactory academic progress –
for example, showing that circumstances which impeded their academic performance are no
Inherent requirements
6.22. Many RMIT programs have defined their inherent requirements (the non-academic abilities needed to
complete a given program). The purposes of defining inherent requirements are to:
— enable students to make an informed choice about whether they believe they can succeed in the
— clarify what reasonable adjustments the university and the program can make to help a student
succeed, without compromising the program’s inherent requirements.
6.23. For further detail on inherent requirements, see the Commitment Statement on Program Inherent
Supplementary assessments
6.24. A supplementary assessment is an exceptional further assessment opportunity so that a school/
industry cluster can determine whether a student has achieved the learning outcomes of a course.
6.25. Students are not entitled to apply for a supplementary assessment: supplementary assessments are
only available as follows.
— A course assessment committee may grant a student a supplementary assessment under the
circumstances stated in the course assessment committees section of these processes: see
sections 3.8–3.9 above.
— A program assessment board may grant a student a supplementary assessment under the
circumstances stated in the program assessment boards section of these processes: see
— A College Appeals Committee or the University Appeals Committee may grant a supplementary
assessment as an outcome of an appeal.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 6
6.26. Where a supplementary assessment is granted, the school/industry cluster notifies the student of the
date, time and venue, by email to their student email account, at least five working days before the
supplementary assessment date, unless both the school/industry cluster and the student have agreed
to a shorter period of notice.
6.27. Where the student has initially failed an assessment component or components of a course, the
supplementary assessment is for those components only.
6.28. Wherever possible, a supplementary assessment is prepared by the original assessor or course
coordinator and tests the same areas of skill and depth of knowledge as the original assessment.
6.29. Supplementary assessments should be held as soon as practicable so that students have their course
results in time to finalise their enrolment in the next teaching period.
6.29.1. Where a program is delivered in two standard semesters per year, supplementary assessments
are normally held in the deferred examination period following each semester; other than in
exceptional circumstances, supplementary assessments must be held by the end of the first
week of the following standard semester.
6.29.2. Where a program is delivered in more than two standard teaching periods per year, supplementary
assessments must be held within four weeks after the results publication date for the relevant
6.30. A supplementary assessment can lead to the following result outcomes.
6.30.1. When a student is granted a supplementary assessment, the school/industry cluster that
manages the course records the interim grade SUP (supplementary assessment granted),
which remains until the outcome of the supplementary assessment is known or the interim
grade expiry period passes.
If the student passes the supplementary assessment, and the course is a higher education,
course the school/industry cluster replaces the SUP with an SP grade (an ungraded pass
with a grade point value of 1).
If the student achieves a lower result in the supplementary assessment than they did in the
original assessment task, the school/industry cluster restores the student’s original fail grade
in place of the SUP.
6.30.4. For vocational education courses the school/industry cluster records a grade of CA if the
student demonstrates competency in the supplementary assessment or NYC if they do not.
6.31. The school/industry cluster records the student’s final grade before the deadline for students to add
courses for the next standard teaching period, unless exceptional circumstances prevent the school
from meeting this deadline.
6.32. These processes do not apply to:
6.32.1 Foundation Studies
6.32.2 Higher Degrees by Research
6.32.3 non-award courses.
Maximum time to complete a coursework program
6.33. Students are required to complete all study to fulfil the requirements of their program within certain
time limits to ensure:
6.33.1 currency of knowledge for RMIT graduates
that the University has the capacity to accept new students.
6.34. Students who cannot complete the program within the maximum time can be classified by the
Program Assessment Board as at risk in accordance with the academic progress processes described
6.35. Where students are required to study full-time as a visa condition or as a condition of enrolment in the
particular program, the maximum time for completion is the normal full-time duration plus 50% of the
normal full-time duration.
6.36. For all other students, the maximum time for completion is defined as follows:
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 6
In an undergraduate coursework program, the maximum time is the normal part-time
duration plus 50% of the normal part-time duration, up to a maximum total time of 20
teaching periods or 10 years.
In a postgraduate coursework program, the maximum time is twice the normal part-time
If a program has a non-standard volume of learning because all students enter on the basis
of a qualification for which they would otherwise have to receive a substantial block of credit
(e.g. a 192 credit points bachelor degree or a 96 credit points master degree) then the
maximum time for completion is calculated as described.
6.37. To calculate the time a student has been enrolled in a program (the time enrolled), the time starts on
the start date of the first class in which the student is enrolled in the program.
6.38. Teaching periods in which it is optional for the student to enrol, such as the Spring and Summer
Semesters in Melbourne, are not included in the calculation of the time enrolled. Where, however, the
program structure requires students to enrol in those semesters, they are counted in the calculation.
6.39. Work experience in industry or co-op years that are part of the approved program structure are
included in both the program’s normal duration and the student’s enrolled time.
6.40. The following periods of time are excluded from the calculation of a student’s time enrolled:
6.40.1 Periods of approved leave of absence.
6.40.2 Periods of exclusion for sustained unsatisfactory academic performance.
6.40.3 Periods of suspension under the student conduct policy.
6.41. Where a continuing student fails to enrol, their enrolment is discontinued and they subsequently apply
for readmission to the program or to a replacement program that is considered by the University to be
the same program, all of the intervening time is considered to be part of the student’s time enrolled, as
the University has not initiated or approved the student’s absence.
6.42. Where a student is transitioned to a new version of a program or a replacement program, the student’s
time enrolled is still considered to have started from the first day of the first teaching period in which
they were enrolled in their original program. This should be made clear to students in the letter
informing them of the transition arrangements.
6.43. Where a student is admitted to an unrelated program, the count of time enrolled starts from the first
day of the first teaching period in which the student is enrolled in the new program.
6.44. Tables 1 and 2 set out the normal durations and maximum times for all students in the types of

Assessment – review and appeal processes
Review of assessment and appeals
The remaining sections of these processes set out the processes to be followed if a student wishes
to seek review of, or appeal against:
— their final assessment result for a course, or
— their exclusion from their program for continued unsatisfactory academic performance, or
— a denied outcome of a special consideration application, or
— a denied equitable assessment arrangement.
The school/industry cluster that manages the relevant course is responsible for resolving studentinitiated reviews of assessment results by the processes below.
Grounds for review and appeal of a final course assessment result
7.3. Students are entitled to seek a review of their final result for a course, or appeal against their final result
in the course, where they provide evidence that at least one of the following grounds of review or appeal
there’s been an error in the calculation of the result, or
the assessment(s) didn’t comply with the description of the assessment or the assessment
criteria published in the course guide, or
the assessment(s) or the assessment criteria published in the course guide aren’t consistent
with the requirements of the relevant training package or accredited course, or
the assessment didn’t comply with the assessment policy or processes or another relevant
rule or University policy (that is, there’s been an error in process), and this had a significant
impact on the result.
Stage one – school/industry cluster-level review of final course result
7.4. Where a student has evidence of at least one of the grounds in section 7.3 above, they must first ask the
course coordinator/program manager responsible for the course to review the final grade for the course.
Students are recommended to request these reviews within five working days from the
publication of the result, so they will still have time to appeal the result if necessary.
7.4.2. Where the course coordinator/program manager isn’t available the student may ask the
dean/head of school/associate director to review the result.
7.5. Assessments for research component courses in bachelor honours or masters by coursework programs,
of 24 credit points or more, are assessed by more than one assessor: accordingly marks for these
assessments are considered already to have been reviewed.
This rule includes research components that take the form of a single research or professional
practice project, or dissertation or thesis, carried out in two 12 credit points courses.
Students can however appeal a result in such courses by the process in sections 7.10–7.16
7.6. Schools/industry clusters are expected to consider reviews as a matter of urgency, so that the student
knows the outcome of the review before the end of their appeal time-frame (see section 7.11 below).
RMIT University | Assessment Processes
7.7. Possible outcomes of a review are:
7.7.1. None of the grounds for review are considered to be met and the result stands.
7.7.2. One or more of the grounds for review is considered to be met and the result is changed.
An independent assessor (either internal or external) is asked to re-assess the student’s
The reviewer may ask the chair of the course assessment committee responsible for the
course to approve the granting of a supplementary assessment.
A vocational education student cannot be granted a pass (competent) result in place of a fail (not yet
competent) result as the outcome of a review. The student must be assessed as competent in an
assessment that meets the requirements of the standards for National VET Regulator Registered
Training Organisations.
If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome of review and has evidence of one or more of the grounds
of review/appeal in section 7.3 above, they may appeal the result to the College Appeals Committee.
Appeals against final course assessment results
7.10. Students can appeal a final course assessment result to the College Appeals Committee (ColAC)
7.10.1. provide evidence of at least one of the grounds of review/appeal in section 7.3 above, and
7.10.2. demonstrate that they asked for a review of the result as described in sections 7.4–7.8 above
but are dissatisfied with the outcome or have received no response.
7.11. Students submit appeals to the ColAC using the Application for Appeals – College Appeals Committee
7.11.1. They must submit the completed appeal form to the deputy vice-chancellor of the college
that includes the school/industry cluster which manages the course.
7.11.2. They must submit the form within 20 working days from the date of publication of the result.
7.11.3. Students are advised to submit their appeal early, so that the outcome of their appeal can
be decided in time for them to make any adjustments to their enrolment in the next teaching
7.12. Where the college deputy vice-chancellor or their nominee decides that the student appeal meets the
grounds for appeal, the ColAC is normally convened to hear the appeal within 20 working days from
the day the college received the appeal submission, unless:
— more time is needed to negotiate a resolution with the school/industry cluster, or
— exceptional circumstances warrant a delay.
7.13. A vocational education student cannot be granted a pass (competent) result in place of a fail (not yet
competent) result as the outcome of an appeal. The student must be assessed as competent in an
assessment that meets the requirements of the standards for National VET Regulator Registered
Training Organisations.
7.14. The ColAC advises the student (by email to their student email account) and the dean/head of school/
industry cluster of the outcome of the appeal within five working days of the appeal hearing.
7.14.1. The notification informs the student of further avenues of appeal/review available to them.
7.15. Subject to the following limited exceptions, the appeal outcome from a ColAC is final and cannot be
7.16. Where a student identifies a breach of university regulation, policy or process in the handling of their
appeal by the ColAC, which has had a significant impact on the outcome, they may appeal the outcome
to the University Appeals Committee.
7.16.1. Such appeals must be submitted within 10 working days of the day on which the notification
of the ColAC outcome was sent to the student.
7.16.2. Such appeals must specify the breach of regulation, policy or process that the student believes
has occurred and provide evidence to demonstrate how this had significant impact on the
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 7
7.17. Vocational education students who believe the course assessment did not meet the requirements of
the relevant training package or accredited course can seek a review of the matter by the Victorian
Registration and Qualifications Authority or Higher Education Skills Victoria.
Appeals against exclusion
7.18. Students with a current enrolment (including those on an approved period of leave of absence) are
entitled to appeal the decision to exclude them from a program for continued unsatisfactory academic
performance to the University Appeals Committee (UAC) if they meet one or more of the following
7.18.1. They provide evidence that the decision to exclude was made on the basis of personal bias
7.18.2. They provide evidence that there was a breach of a relevant rule or University policy in the
handling of the exclusion process, which had a significant impact on the decision to exclude
7.18.3. They provide significant new, relevant evidence applicable to the period/s of unacceptable
academic performance that was not available at the time the student was required to show
cause why they should not be excluded.
7.18.4. They provide evidence that the penalty of exclusion is unreasonable, excessive or
inappropriate (this includes evidence of compassionate or compelling circumstances).
7.19. For a student’s appeal to be considered, they must:
— submit it within 20 working days of the day on which the Academic Registrar sent the notification
— use the appeal against exclusion form, which is available from the appeal forms web page.
7.20. A student who has been notified of their exclusion must remain enrolled and can continue to attend
classes until the end of the 20 working days period in which they may appeal the decision. If they
appeal, they must remain enrolled and can continue to attend classes until the outcome of their
7.20.1. A student appealing against exclusion is not entitled to receive final results for any courses
in which they’re currently enrolled unless the appeal is successful or the exclusion decision
is overturned on external review.
7.20.2. Where a student has been notified of their exclusion, and is on approved leave of absence,
the exclusion will replace the leave of absence once any appeal process is complete, unless
the appeal is successful or the exclusion decision is overturned on external review.
7.20.3. Student disclosures of concerning, threatening or inappropriate behaviour are to be managed
in accordance with Assessment – general processes, section 1.54).
If the student’s appeal application to the UAC is assessed by the Academic Registrar or their nominee
as meeting the grounds in section 7.18 above, the School, Industry Cluster or College will be invited to
review the decision to exclude the student.
If the School, Industry Cluster or College retracts the exclusion decision and permits the
student to continue in the program at first stage at risk, the relevant academic services team
will arrange an academic advice intervention as in sections 6.8–6.10 above.
If the School, Industry Cluster or College doesn’t retract the exclusion decision, the appeal
will be heard by the UAC, normally within 20 working days from the day the UAC secretariat
considered the submission to be complete. In exceptional circumstances, it may take up to
30 working days to hear the appeal where negotiation with the school/industry cluster is
If the UAC dismisses the appeal, the UAC secretariat will inform the student of the outcome and that
they have 10 working days to seek an external review of this decision if they choose.
If a student applies for external review of the decision to exclude them, and provides satisfactory
evidence of this application to the UAC secretariat, they will remain enrolled or on approved
leave of absence (as relevant) until the outcome of the review application is known.
RMIT University | Assessment ProcessesChapter 7
If the student does not provide satisfactory evidence that they have applied for external review
within 10 working days after the date the notification of the UAC decision is emailed to them, or
if they apply for external review and the outcome is that the exclusion stands, the Academic
Registrar’s Group will cancel the student’s enrolment as of the date of the original exclusion
notification, removing results for assessments attempted during the appeal and external
review period (see section 6.17.9 above).
Appeals against special consideration outcomes
7.23. Students cannot appeal against a granted, withdrawn or cancelled special consideration outcome.
However, students can request a review of a cancelled outcome due to lateness or failure to provide
supporting documentation: see the special consideration web page for the process for these reviews.
7.24. A student may appeal to the University Appeals Committee (UAC) against a denied outcome of a
special consideration application.
7.25. For an appeal to be considered:
the student must submit the application on the appeal against a special consideration
outcome form (available from the appeal forms web page) within 10 working days after
the date the email notifying the student of the outcome was sent; and
the appeal must meet one of the following grounds:
— the student has provided additional relevant information or evidence that was not available
at the time of the original application, which would have had a significant impact on the
special consideration outcome
— the student has provided evidence of a breach of a relevant rule, University regulation,
policy or process that would have had a significant impact on the special consideration
7.26. On receipt of the appeal, the UAC secretariat invites ARG Integrity to review the appeal submission
together with the relevant special consideration application.
If following this review:
7.27.1. ARG Integrity doesn’t change the outcome of the special consideration application to
the Academic Registrar or their nominee assesses the student’s appeal application as meeting
the grounds in section 7.3 above, then
the appeal will be heard by the UAC.
Review and appeals in relation to equitable assessment arrangements
7.28. Where a student who registers with Equitable Learning Services (ELS) is not granted an equitable
learning plan (ELP), or is dissatisfied with the ELP they’re granted, they may ask the Associate Director
Equity and Inclusion to review it.
7.28.1. To be eligible for this review a student must provide new evidence that their ELP does not
provide an adjustment in accordance with University policy or the Disability Standards for
7.29. A student may appeal to the University Appeals Committee against a decision not to grant them an
equitable assessment arrangement (EAA) or against a decision not to provide them with an alternative
assessment arrangement (AAA).
7.30. For such an appeal to be considered,
the student must submit their appeal using the appeal against an equitable assessment
arrangement form (available from the appeal forms web page) within 10 working days
following the day on which they were emailed the notification of the decision not to grant
them an EAA or not to provide them with an AAA, and
the student must provide evidence that the decision involved a breach of the relevant
standard, University regulation, policy or process, that would have had a significant impact
7.30.3. That there is new evidence that was not available at the time of their application.
