[Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access at RMIT](/about/our-values/diversityand-inclusion)
### Inclusive by design: Everyone, everywhere, all the time.
RMIT has a long and proud history of commitments and action to ensure that
opportunities to develop and succeed are open to everyone.
Through previous diversity and inclusion action plans, RMIT has made
significant progress, with improvements in the diversity of representation in
our student and staff community and in their experience and outcomes.
We have also been recognised as a leader for our commitments and achievements
as measured by our performance in several rigorous national and international
benchmarking schemes.

RMIT’s IDEA Framework that serves our international community, identifying
what RMIT is doing well, where we still need to improve, and what we need to
Inclusion and everything it infers is core to our knowledge with action
strategy, and it's integral to the way we contribute to the communities we
serve. The IDEA framework is about hardwiring inclusion into every system and
process that underpins the significant institution that we are. Education is
transformational, but it's only successful if everybody, regardless of their
background, has not just the opportunity but the conditions required to
achieve their ambition.
IDEA is a binding promise to everyone, everywhere, all the time. At its heart
is an inclusive mindset where learner success is as important as opportunity.
Our IDEA framework represents a step up in maturity around inclusion,
diversity, equity, and access at RMIT. It's grounded in principles of
Universal Design and intersectionality, and it looks at the systems and
processes that we need to shift to create better inclusion for all people.
In developing the IDEA framework, we have had conversations with staff,
students, and researchers about their lived experience. Implementing the IDEA
framework is an ongoing invitation to a conversation to make sure that all
voices are recognized, respected, and celebrated. Together, we co-create
solutions to ensure that we address the barriers to their full participation
in RMIT University life.
IDEA is essential, IDEA is leadership. So, IDEA at RMIT is inclusive by
design. It's informed by lived experience, and it's the right thing to do.
Our **Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access (IDEA) Framework** creates a
blueprint for our continued journey towards a more inclusive and accessible

\- **Alec Cameron, Vice-Chancellor and President**
At the heart of how we live our values, including the RMIT value of inclusion,
is our commitment to a just and meaningful relationship between Indigenous
communities and the RMIT community. This means adopting ‘Responsible Practice’
by considering and enacting positive change for First Nations People as part
of our everyday work and study at RMIT.
To achieve our strategic aspirations, we need to ensure that everyone is
included and enabled to thrive, whoever and wherever they are. We aim to shape
an RMIT that is Inclusive by design: Everyone, everywhere, all the time.

## Background
### Background
Grounded in principles of inclusion and accessibility, consultation included a
range of modes. The voices of our students and staff were critical in shaping
RMIT’s IDEA Framework that serves our international community, identifying
what RMIT is doing well, where we still need to improve, and what we need to
We considered both quantitative and qualitative data, looking at the
representation, experience and outcomes for diverse learners and staff. We
reviewed our performance against rigorous national and international
benchmarking schemes. We considered the requirements of relevant legislation,
policy and regulation, and drew on research and practice insights, including
from our own staff experts.
While we were able to capture a broad range of voices, lived experience and
perspectives, we know that we did not hear from everyone. New issues and
challenges will also continue to emerge. Seeking to understand and respond to
the diversity of identities and experiences of our community over time is an
## Key insights
### Key insights
* Our past plans and actions that focus on issues and individual identities (such as gender or disability) have served us well, but a more holistic approach is required.
* **The diversity of our learners and staff needs to better reflect the broader population in the communities we serve** , particularly when we consider distribution across our disciplines, our work roles, and in progression through RMIT
* Our students and staff want to **see visible diverse role models** , to believe that they can stay, succeed and progress.
* They also want us to make sure that everyone who comes to RMIT is aware of our value of inclusion, that **we are working to identify and address structural and systemic barriers and inequities, and their drivers** , and that we support all staff and students to develop their inclusive practice.
* Because we have not always considered **the needs across our diverse community** when we are planning new programs, policies, or services, not all staff and learners can participate equitably from day one, so we undertake costly and inefficient remediation or individual provision to ‘make things work’ for individuals.
* There is an opportunity for us to **commit to designing for universal provision for all people** , personalised where needed to support the ways individuals learn and work best.
## Guiding principles
### Guiding principles
In order to achieve inclusion, diversity and equity, we need to:
* Drive an intersectional whole-of-institution approach, sharing and celebrating our good practice and aligning around common aspirations
* Embed ‘Responsible Practice’ in our thinking and doing, by every member of our community
* Be ‘inclusive by design’ by planning for the diversity of the community from the outset in whatever we do
* Support insight and action on inclusion, diversity, equity and access across all locations and operations in the RMIT Group
* Have the flexibility to respond to emerging needs and priorities
## Our aspirations
### Our aspirations
The IDEA framework identifies five domains of Inclusive Excellence that define
the aspirations and priority action areas to drive action across RMIT Group.
Through the domains, we will address systems, processes, policies,
capabilities and cultural norms to progress our goal of being “Inclusive by
design” for everyone, everywhere, all the time.
Across these five domains, our aspirations are:
* **Access, participation and success** : We aim to build a more diverse student and staff profile with equity in retention, success and outcomes.
* **Culture, capability and leadership** : We will create an environment where all individuals are supported, are respected, feel a sense of belonging.
* **Education and research:** We will demonstrate best practice in inclusion, diversity, equity and access through our education and research.
* **Infrastructure, service and operations:** We will provide inclusive facilities and services, and plan, resource and communicate our IDEA aspirations and achievements.
* **Community and partnerships:** We aim to engage reciprocally and in partnership with the communities we serve, promoting equity, diversity, inclusion and wellbeing.
## Making it happen
### Making it happen
Implementing the IDEA Framework will involve working with Colleges, Portfolios
and entities to identify their current maturity level in IDEA to ascertain
locally led leadership priorities.
The first horizon of implementation will include the establishment of baseline
measures to enable ambitious, but achievable targets with an overall goal of
parity in representation, success, outcomes and experiences of the whole RMIT
community. It is expected that measures and evaluation will iterate across the
three horizons of the framework.
Evaluating our impact will include continuous feedback from our learners,
staff and key partners.
This will include assessing our position as a leader in inclusion, diversity,
equity and access against external benchmarks and peak body research,
identifying and measuring learner and workforce demographics against
comparative populations and analysing qualitative and quantitative feedback.
Achievement of our aspirations will require a whole-of-RMIT approach. There is
a wealth of good work already happening across the Group, enabled through
existing diversity-focussed networks, committees and working groups. These
will support the implementation of this Framework, along with a forum for
information and practice sharing.

## Governance
Our progress towards our commitments in our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and
Access Framework is overseen by the RMIT [Diversity and Inclusion Advisory
Committee](/content/dam/rmit/rmit-images/staff-site/myemployment/documents/diversity-and-inclusion/EDIAC-terms-of-reference.docx)
(DOCX 364KB), co-chaired by Professor Calum Drummond, Deputy Vice-Chancellor
Research and Innovation, a member of the Vice-Chancellor’s Executive (VCE).
Actions are driven by the Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access Teams in
both the People Team - Operations, led by Tara Waller - Director, Employee
Experience and Capability, Mat Lewis - Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access
Manager, and the Equity and Inclusion team in Students Group - Education
portfolio, under the leadership of Lara Rafferty - Associate Director, Student
Work towards the goals of the RMIT Athena Swan Action Plan is driven by
Professor Kay Latham, Associate Deputy Vice Chancellor, Gender Equity.
We have multiple working groups spanning our diversity focus areas. Progress
is reported to the VCE and Council via the Diversity and Inclusion Advisory
Committee in annual reports:
