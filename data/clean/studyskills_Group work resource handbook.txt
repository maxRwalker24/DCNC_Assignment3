Study Tips: Reflective writing process 1 May 2015
Reflective writing aims to help you focus on signif icant new insights you have gained through
course work, practical placement (WIL), academic re ading, etc. A reflective assignment may
require a series of individual reflections, or focu s on one. This outline presents an approach to
writing a reflection, using the ‘DIEP’ strategy. *
1.1. 1.1. Choose something to reflect on Choose something to reflect on Choose something to reflect on Choose something to reflect on
• Identify an insight insight insight insight (an interesting or illuminating new thing y ou learned) from reading, course work, studio,
− Focus on something that may change your thinking (o r be important for you) that you hadn’t realised.
− Think about what the significance of this new insig ht might be for your learning and future practice.
• Note any important details about the insight—where, when, who with, etc. If the insight came from
reading, note all the important details of the idea , and include the author, publication, references, etc.
2. Brainstorm 2. Brainstorm 2. Brainstorm 2. Brainstorm
• Bring your ideas about this new insight together on one page to:
− identify the significance of your new learning: que stion why it is important
− detect connections between this idea and other idea s or material in the course or program
− locate possible course material and other sources o f information that support/explain your insight/s
− give you the beginnings of a plan.
• Write questions to answer or use a mind-map to clar ify your thinking about your insights
3. Plan a 3. Plan a 3. Plan a 3. Plan an in i n in initialnitialnitialnitial structure structure structure structure
• Use the DIEP strategy (overleaf) to decide on your main points. Use headings to guide your planning.
− Decide on your main insight. Plan a brief descripti on of how this insight came about for the first
− Organise the body paragraphs. This is the interpret ation and evaluation of the insight: draft possible
topic sentences. Make connections with course work and other learning, and with the literature.
− Draft some points for the final paragraph: indicate how this new learning will transfer to your future
study and professional practice (and personal life? ).
4. 4. 4. 4. Conduct your Conduct your Conduct your Conduct your research research research research
• Look for academic material that connects with your new learning. Start with general reading, using cou rse
material, recommended texts, and books from the lib rary.
• Identify search terms from this reading to help you conduct a more refined search of academic database s.
• You may need to research in areas outside your imme diate discipline area, in addition to course materi al.

• Expand each point you want to make, focusing your r esearch to expand on your main points.

• Write the body paragraphs containing one main idea (interpreting and evaluating the insight) stated in the
topic sentence. Other sentences explain, support an d give detail, with evidence from research and/or
examples. Integrate theory and include references a s you go. Expect to write a number of drafts.

• Save additional copies of your submitted reflection in other locations e.g. RMIT H-drive, USB, laptop etc.
Study Tips: Reflective writing process 2 May 2015
DIEP* is a strategy to help with writing a critical or academic reflection in four paragraphs.
The four steps in this approach are to describe describe describe describe an insight (new understanding), to interpr et interpret interpret interpret and evaluate evaluate evaluate evaluate it, and
to plan plan plan plan how it might transfer to future practice or le arning.
First, select an experience or insight to reflect o n. Then attempt to:
• analyse your learning and deepening understanding
• evaluate your gains in understanding and developmen t, while acknowledging any complexities
• integrate the concepts taught in courses (including references to the literature, where relevant)
• focus on your developing confidence and cognition, and verbalise your feelings about your learning
• make connections with theories in your course and/o r program, and other relevant ideas/experiences
• demonstrate transfer of learning to your study, pra ctice, and to your future professional life.
