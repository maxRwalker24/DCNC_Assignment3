### Find answers to frequently asked questions about Equitable Learning Plans,
extensions and special consideration for students with a Plan, and more.
### Getting and maintaining your Equitable Learning Plan
[ Expand all sections ](javascript:void\(0\))
## Should I disclose my disability/condition to RMIT?
You only need to tell the Equitable Learning Services (ELS) team about your
diagnosis if it will impact your study experience at RMIT and you need support
## When do I need to contact ELS if I require support?
You can contact ELS at any time during your studies. However, we recommend
students to register with us **as early in the semester as possible** so that
you can access relevant support early and maximise your opportunities to
Each semester there is a cut-off date for making changes to your assessment
adjustments (usually 2-3 weeks before the final assessment period). This means
you need to contact us before this date, otherwise we may not be able to
arrange your assessment adjustments. If the cut-off date for assessment
adjustments has passed, you may still be able to request an [extension or
special consideration](/students/my-course/assessment-results/specialconsideration-extensions).
## What happens after I register?
After you tell us about your condition and you register with ELS, we will work
with you to reduce the impact of your disability on your ability to
consistently participate in your studies.
* Email a PDF copy of your Equitable Learning Plan (the document we discussed at your appointment) to your student email. The email will be sent from 'RMIT Connect'
* Send your Equitable Learning Plan to your School for distribution to your teaching staff each semester
* Send your Equitable Learning Plan to the Library so they can better help you use Library resources and find accessible information. Find out more about [disability and neurodiversity library support](/library/study/disability-neurodiversity-support).
* Read your Equitable Learning Plan, and get to know it well
* Email your Equitable Learning Plan to new teaching staff throughout the academic year, and/or or WIL Coordinator, if your plan includes recommended adjustments for internships or work placements
* Ensure that your Equitable Learning Plan is working. If you are concerned about how your Equitable Learning Plan is being implemented, speak to your teachers first. If your Equitable Learning Plan isn’t being followed, [contact the ELS team](/students/support-services/equitable-learning) immediately.
## How long will my Equitable Learning Plan last?
During your appointment, the ELS Advisor will determine the appropriate length
of time for your ELP to be in place. The expiry date will take into
consideration the length of time of your program/degree and the duration of
time that your condition/disability will impact on your studies based on the
documentation we receive. Students will be advised of the expiration date of
their ELP prior to your plan being published and distributed.
## My Equitable Learning Plan has expired or will expire soon. What do I do?
If your Equitable Learning Plan expires, you can [contact
ELS](/students/support-services/equitable-learning#contact) to renew it. You
may need to provide documentation that confirms your disability/condition is
ongoing and/or continues to impact your studies.
## I didn’t need ELS support or an Equitable Learning Plan when I started my
studies, but now I think I might need help. Can I apply for ELS support even
though I’m not a new student?
Yes, absolutely. You can request ELS support at any time during your studies.
We encourage you to [send an enquiry to ELS](/students/supportservices/equitable-learning#contact) outlining your circumstances so an ELS
Advisor can assist you and discuss next steps.
## If I update/change my disability status on RMIT systems (Enrolment
Online), will ELS automatically contact me about available supports?
No, changing your disability or long-term health condition status via
Enrolment Online will **NOT** automatically trigger access to disability or
equitable learning support. If you need additional support due to your
disability, long-term illness or mental health condition, please [send an
enquiry to ELS](/students/support-services/equitable-learning#contact)
outlining your circumstances so an ELS Advisor can assist you and discuss next
## VIDEO: Top tips for students from an ELS Advisor
![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Gw5Ewo84DYY/maxresdefault.jpg)
### Top tips for students seeking ELS support
Equitable Learning Advisor, Sarah, shares her top tips for students navigating
their studies with an Equitable Learning Plan.
### Top tips for students seeking ELS support
Equitable Learning Advisor, Sarah, shares her top tips for students navigating
their studies with an Equitable Learning Plan.
Hi, my name's Sarah and I work at RMIT's Equitable learning Service. I'm here
today to share with you my top five tips for learning, so these are important
things you can consider before you start your semester, and this should help
you be set up and really enjoy your studies with the adjustments flexibility
and support in place that you require throughout your program.
Tip Number One: Think about how you learn best
So it can be helpful sometimes to think about previous learning experience
that you've had, for example, through high school or other TAFE or university
courses you may have done. What worked for you and what didn't? Did you have
any adjustments, flexibility or supporting place that you found really
helpful? Or were there things that you were missing that could have been
Tip Number Two: Get to know your program
So it's really good to do a bit of research into the actual program
requirements, how it's set up and what's involved. So this can include looking
into the types of assessments that you may have, for example, is there any
work integrated learning placements, internships or external accreditation you
need to pass? What do the assessments look like? Are they group assessments,
presentations, exams or folios? That's really helpful if you know this going
into your program so if you meet with the Equitable Learning Service you know
what to expect, where your strengths and weaknesses might be and what
adjustments could be helpful.
Tip Number Three: Get support in place early
So the sooner you contact us the better. Our best advice would be to book an
appointment with the Equitable Learning Service or reach out to us via email
at the very beginning of semester if not before. This means that we can unpack
what challenges might arise for you, for example, do you get really
overwhelmed as assessments start to pile up? Or are you concerned about having
to do a placement or an internship? We can plan with you how you will manage
these things. We can put adjustments into your ELP and then that way they're
available to you at those stressful times. If you leave things till the last
minute it can be really tricky for us to get supports in place for you quickly
and often it will involve you having to negotiate with teachers, apply for
special consideration and that can cause extra stress. So the more you plan
ahead and the earlier you reach out for support, the better.
Tip Number Four: Keep in regular contact with your support team
So this might include us the Equitable Learning Service as well as your
teachers and tutors and perhaps some additional supports such as the Careers
team or the Library study supports or mental health supports such as your
counsellor and that might be RMIT's counselling service or your own personal
counsellor or psychologist and other medical supports who might be able to
assist through during times of stress or just give you some strategies on how
to cope up during the studies at RMIT. So the more that we know about what's
going on for you throughout each semester, the more we can help.
Tip Number Five: Obtain any supporting documents outlining your condition and
how it impacts on your study
So if you can visit your GP, counsellor, psychiatrist or another registered
health practitioner and get one to support you with filling in our forms, it
means that when you meet with us for an appointment we've got everything we
need to put together and publish your Equitable Learning Plan. So we recommend
that you book an appointment with your health practitioner as soon as you know
you're going to need supports during your study and email that back to us so
that we have everything saved to your confidential student file and can then
put some adjustments in place for you. Some students don't have a regular GP
or health practitioner that they can see so please let us know if this is the
case and we can help with referrals or you could also book in at the RMIT
Medical Hub which is a really great starting point.
### Your privacy and information
[ Expand all sections ](javascript:void\(0\))
## What information do I need to provide?
When you attend your appointment with ELS, you can talk to an advisor about
how your disability impacts your ability to take part in your studies. You
will need to provide supporting documentation from your registered health
practitioner and an ELS registration form. These can be found on the
[Equitable learning and disability page](/students/support-services/equitablelearning).
## Who will have the information of my disability/condition?
The information you choose to share with us is kept confidential and it won’t
be on any of your academic records. In the initial appointment with an ELS
advisor, you will be able to decide what is or is not shared with your
academic/teaching staff on your Equitable Learning Plan.
## Who can complete my supporting documents to confirm my
disability/condition?
Your supporting documents must be completed by a qualified health professional
with expertise in your disability. They must be registered with a recognised
board (e.g., Medicare or AHPRA) for verification.
For example, for mental health conditions, documentation from registered
psychologists, psychiatrists, a treating GP, or an accredited mental health
social worker is acceptable. We cannot accept documentation from professionals
outside this scope, such as physiotherapists or audiologists, nor from
relatives or friends. Existing reports or assessments that reflect the impact
of your disability can be used as a substitute for Part B of the registration
If you are unsure of the suitability of your supporting documentation or
treating practitioner, please contact us via [Student
Connect](https://rmit.servicenow.com/connect?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=2c207a60dba6c890b8b9126b3a96199c).
### Your rights and responsibilities
[ Expand all sections ](javascript:void\(0\))
## What are my rights if I disclose my disability/condition?
When you tell us about your disability, long-term illness and/or mental health
condition, you have the right to:
* Only disclose to the ELS team to organise appropriate assistance, without having to disclose your disability to teachers staff
* Have your personal information treated confidentially and respectfully
All staff at RMIT must treat your personal information confidentially and
respectfully in accordance with the Information Privacy Act 2000 and the
Health Records Act 2001.
## What are my responsibilities as an Equitable Learning Plan holder?
You are responsible for:
* Advising ELS staff in a timely manner of your needs in relation to your disability. If your needs or circumstances change during study, please [contact ELS](/students/support-services/equitable-learning#contact) to so we can review your ELP as needed
* Understanding the requirements of the program or course that you are undertaking. This may include being aware of the [inherent requirements](/study-with-us/applying-to-rmit/local-student-applications/entry-requirements/inherent-requirements) for registering with a relevant professional body
* If your ELP includes adjustments for enabling staff, you must adhere to the requirements outlined in the Enabling Assistance Student Handbook. The handbook is provided to students who have an ELP that includes adjustments for enabling staff. Please communicate any changes to your enabling staff bookings to ELS as outlined in the handbook
* Like all students, you must follow and adhere to the requirements outlined in the [RMIT Student Charter](/students/student-life/rights-responsibilities/charter).
### Assessments and extensions
[ Expand all sections ](javascript:void\(0\))
## How do I ask for an extension?
If you have the Equitable Assessment Arrangement for ‘Extensions’ within your
Equitable Learning Plan, please ask your teacher how you should apply for an
[extension](/students/my-course/assessment-results/special-considerationextensions/extensions) before the adjustment is due. Different courses use
different extension application processes, so you may be required to:
* Apply for an extension via Canvas
* Apply for an extension via email to your teacher or Course Coordinator or
* Complete and submit an extension application form
Please note, this adjustment only applies to individual assessments and
extensions must be requested **at least one business/working day** before the
deadline.You cannot seek an extension if the due date has passed.
Clearly ask for an extension and suggest a reasonable new due date that
considers the impacts of your disability, illness and/or mental health
condition and the type of assessment – a template with suggested wording that
you can adapt is below.
The most common extension is **seven days** for an individual assessment. For
group assessments, you can request an extension of **up to seven days**
without having to use your ELP and disclose you have adjustments to other
You can only request **one extension per assessment** using your ELP. If you
need a second extension, you must apply for [special
consideration](/students/my-course/assessment-results/special-considerationextensions/special-consideration).
##### Template/suggested wording
Here is a template you can adapt when requesting an extension for individual
assessments, giving at least one working day notice to teaching staff. The
“describe your circumstances” section can be helpful to add context for your
request to the academic. Attach your ELP to the email.
_I would like to request an extension of [XX DAYS] (eg. 7 days, 14 days) for
[ASSIGNMENT NAME]. I would like to submit on [ENTER PROPOSED DEADLINE HERE],
with your permission._
_I am registered with ELS and have an Equitable Learning Plan (ELP), see
attached. My ELP includes an extensions Equitable Assessment Arrangement
(EAA), enabling me to negotiate extensions with individual course coordinators._
_I am requesting this extension due to [DESCRIBE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES – E.G.
ONGOING IMPACTS OF MY CONDITION, AN EXACERBATION OF MY CONDITION, MY PRIMARY
CARER ROLE ETC]. As outlined in my ELP, I can request an extension relating to
my ELS registration of greater than 7 days without going through special
_Please provide a response regarding this proposed extension – I am happy to
discuss this further if needed. If you would like further advice regarding
this process, please contact Equitable Learning Services._
_Regards [Your name]_
## How many days can I request for an extension (7 days, 14 days, etc)?
If you have the Equitable Assessment Arrangement for ‘Extensions’ within your
Equitable Learning Plan, you can request an extension for individual
assessments (eg. essays, assignments, portfolios and projects).
The length of the extension is dependent on the impact of your condition on
learning, the assessment weighting and the assessment format. The most common
request is for an extension of 7 days, but you can apply for a longer period
(eg. 10 days, 14 days) if needed.
There may be occasions when students are required to negotiate extension
lengths with their educators to ensure that they are reasonable and
appropriate to the circumstances. If issues arise, you can [contact
ELS](/students/support-services/equitable-learning#contact) for advice or
## Can I request more than one extension for the same assessment/assignment?
No, if you have the Equitable Assessment Arrangement for ‘Extensions’ within
your Equitable Learning Plan, you can only request **one extension per
assessment** using your ELP. If you need a second extension, you must apply
for [special consideration](/students/my-course/assessment-results/specialconsideration-extensions/special-consideration).
## Can I request more than one extension for the same course/subject?
Yes, if you have the Equitable Assessment Arrangement for ‘Extensions’ within
your Equitable Learning Plan, you can request **one extension per assessment**
So, if your course has 4 assessments, you can request 4 extensions (one for
each assessment). But you can’t request more than one extension for the same
assessment (see question above).
## I've requested an extension via email and I haven't had a response. What
If you can't get a response from your teacher, please contact your Program
Manager. If you don't hear back, [contact ELS](/students/supportservices/equitable-learning#contact) for assistance.
## My School has asked me to fill out a form when requesting an extension. Do
If you have Equitable Assessment Arrangement for 'Extensions', your Learning
Plan is the only evidence you need to provide. You may need to fill out a form
if your School requires it, but you do not need to provide a medical
certificate or any additional evidence.
## My teacher has directed me to apply for special consideration even though
I have the Equitable Assessment Arrangement for extensions. What do I do?
If it is your first extension, you do not need to apply for special
consideration. Direct your teacher to your Equitable Learning Plan where this
is clearly stated. If you aren’t able to implement your extension request,
[contact ELS](/students/support-services/equitable-learning#contact) for
If you require a second extension, you will need to [apply for special
consideration](/students/my-course/assessment-results/special-considerationextensions/special-consideration).
## Can I request an extension for a group assessment with a due date?
Extensions in your ELP only apply to individual assessments. For group
assessments, you can still request up to one week (7 days) extension from your
teaching without using your ELP. This means you do not need to disclose a
condition or ELS registration with other students in your group. If you need a
longer extension for a group assessment, you should apply for [special
consideration](/students/my-course/assessment-results/special-considerationextensions/special-consideration).
## Do my Equitable Assessment Arrangements apply to in-class and online
tests, and practicals?
Yes. They apply to exams, in-class and online tests, and practical based
assessments. If you or your teacher are unsure how to apply your assessment
adjustments, please [contact ELS](/students/support-services/equitablelearning#contact) for clarification.
## I can't attend a timed/scheduled assessment (test, presentation, exam,
etc) due to my condition/s, can I defer the assessment to a later date?
Yes, you can apply for a deferral of a timed/scheduled assessment like a test,
presentation or exam if you have an Equitable Assessment Arrangement for
'Student Absence' within your Equitable Learning Plan. To do this, you must
apply for [special consideration](/students/my-course/assessmentresults/special-consideration-extensions/special-consideration) before the
scheduled assessment or up to 5 working days after the missed assessment.
Attach your ELP as supporting documentation for your request.
## I need adjustments or additional assistance at an internship or work
integrated learning (WIL) placement, who should I talk to?
If you require assistance with managing your condition/s and work requirements
at an internship or WIL placement, please make a [Disability and ELS Career
Appointment via Career
Centre](https://rmit.careercentre.me/resources/events/events.aspx?EventType=Career%20Consultation%20Appointment%20\(ELS\))
