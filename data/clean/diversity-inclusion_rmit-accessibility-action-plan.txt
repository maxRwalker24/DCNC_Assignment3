P1 RMIT Diversity and Inclusion
Accessibility Action Plan
In this Strategic Plan, RMIT affirms its ongoing
commitment to ‘inclusion’ as one of its key values:
RMIT creates life-changing opportunities for
all, welcomes students and staff from diverse
backgrounds, honours the identity and knowledge
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations,
and is an accessible and open institution
dedicated to serving the needs of the whole
Background and current status
In the RMIT Staff Survey conducted in 2015, staff reporting a disability, especially those who require a work-related adjustment, indicated there was room for improvement in RMIT’s practices in supporting staff diversity, safety and wellness.
In relation to students, over the last few years
there have been increases in students enrolled and registered with Disability Services. These students often have significantly more complex needs along with less visible and fluctuating health-related circumstances. For example, over 50% of students registered with Disability Services have a mental health condition.
While much good work has been achieved over
the ten years of our preceding Disability Action Plans, broad consultation with staff, students, specialist agencies, and key stakeholders has identified the need for continued attention to:
ating visible leadership commitment
to inclusion and diversity, and promoting
awareness and appropriate behaviour among staff and students
that our physical and digital
environments are accessible, inclusive, and safe
oviding an equitable and inclusive experience
for all students and staff with disabilityIntroduction
RMIT University’s mission is to create
transformative experiences for students, getting them ready for life and work, and to help shape the world with research, innovation, teaching and engagement.
(Ready for Life and Work: RMIT’s Strategic Plan to 2020)
In addition, consultations emphasised the need
for a strong focus on teaching and learning, by:
tinuing to promote inclusive teaching
and assessment practices as the standard to
support all students
oving the provision of “reasonable
adjustments” to teaching, learning and assessment for individual students as required.
Consistent with our legal and regulatory requirements, and our Strategic Plan values and commitments, this new Accessibility Action Plan sets out actions for the next five years to improve the experience of students, staff and visitors with disabilities.
RMIT commits to promoting this Plan, devoting
appropriate resources to its implementation, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation, and supporting leaders to develop and implement operational plans. We will continue to track and report on indicators regarding the participation and experience of our staff and students with disabilities. The Plan will be lodged with the Australian Human Rights Commission as a demonstration of our commitment to meet the objectives of the Federal Disability Discrimination Act and the Disability Standards for Education.
In adopting and implementing this Accessibility
Action Plan, RMIT demonstrates how it values the richness of diversity among students and staff, and recognises its responsibilities to take University-wide transformative actions to enhance inclusion for staff, students and visitors with disabilities.
