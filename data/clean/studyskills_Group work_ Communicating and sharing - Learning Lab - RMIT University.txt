# Group work: Communicating and sharing
How well your group communicates with each other affects how you work together
and how task information is stored, managed and shared. Good communication is
an advantage for any group. Let's learn how to foster effective communication.
## Agree on how to work together
* Successful groups make decisions as a group and expect all members to contribute equally to the task.
* Share your contact details and agree on the best way of keeping in touch.
* Meet face to face where possible to make decisions and work together effectively.
* Write a group charter to outline how you will work together, what expectations members have and how you will approach the task. Group members need to agree on the charter and sign it.
Here's an example of a **group charter** :
### Group charter: members' responsibilities
All members agree to:
respect group members, demonstrate sensitivity and encourage learning
be fully committed to the group task and your individual agreed
work according to the agreed time frame
give and receive feedback about your work and participate in group discussions
attend all meetings unless unavoidably prevented
agree to resolve conflict according to the group's agreed process as soon as
ensure that all group members contribute equally to the task by addressing
problems with tasks as they arise
agree to collectively read and edit the final group report or essay
provide contact details and respond to group communications as required
## Sharing ideas
Hopefully, in your first meeting you will have decided how you will
communicate as a group. Here are some tips for what can be covered in your
* report on your work: what you have done, what you have learned, what you still need to do
* address problems and talk about possible solutions (product and process problems) as they emerge
* ensure everyone has a chance to speak without interruption
* make decisions about individual responsibilities for actions; e.g. the development of the group's points for the report / presentation
* address the issue of members not contributing ideas, if relevant, and stress that all opinions are needed and valued.
## Set an agenda
Before the meeting, the note taker can send out a request to group members to
suggest any topics that need to be discussed. They can then create an agenda
that that has a description of each item that needs to be discussed by the
group, a field for where the name of the person/people who is responsible for
the task and space the actions that need to be completed.
Here's an example of a meeting agenda:
Item | Responsibility | Action
---|---|--The task | All members |
* Brainstorm the task: each member articulates their understanding of the task
* Summarise group understanding of the task
* Distribute summary with other notes from meeting
| Assignment part 1 and 2: information search | All members |
* Assign two members to each section
* Discuss search strategy databases
* Set deadline
Attending meetings | Josefa (leader) |
* Discussion of importance of attending meetings
* Discussion of how absence affects the group
* Reminder of the group charter
Discuss schedule for upcoming meetings | Lin (note-taker) |
* Discuss group member avialability for the next week
* Send meeting invites

![Abstract artwork titled 'Sentient' by Hollie Johnson, features a complex
pattern of intersecting blue, green, and yellow lines over a white background
showing the journeys of life starting, finishing and intersecting. The
colouring of the line work illustrates the evolution of nature through many
First Nations stories: the sun, the giver of life \(yellow\), the creation of
land \(green\), and the sea \(blue\). Red and black concentric diamond and
semi-circle shapes symbolise men and women respectively, connecting them to
Ancestors who gave birth to them. The artwork is also a representation of RMIT
