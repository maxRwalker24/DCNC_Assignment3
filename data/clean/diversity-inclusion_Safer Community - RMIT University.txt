## Making a report
### Formal reporting to the university
At RMIT we have a dedicated Specialist Investigator and Case Manager in the
Safer Community team. This person provides personalised support and advocacy
for students who wish to make a formal report to the University.
A formal report associated with sexual harassment, harm or violence will be
investigated by the Specialist Investigator. The Investigator provides case
management of the formal report, which includes documenting of interviews any
findings and will provide recommendations for appropriate disciplinary or
associated action to be taken, if allegations or concerns are substantiated.

**[Female voiceover]**
Reporting sexual harm at RMIT. At RMIT, we use the term sexual harm to
describe any sexual behaviour that you don't agree to, that made you feel
uncomfortable or unsafe.
If you have experienced sexual harm and need support, you can contact Safer
Community. It doesn't matter where or when it happened, we will be here to
support you at every step along the way.
So, what happens when you talk to us? First, our trained staff will talk to
you about your options and offer you support. You decide on what you need and
what you choose to do next. We can connect you with other support services
like the Centres Against Sexual Assault or RMIT's free Counselling service. We
can support you to manage the impacts on your study or coursework. You decide.
If what happened relates to a member of our community, you can decide if you
want to report it to the University. The University will conduct an
investigation. It will be separate to any police investigation. The University
will consider all available information and decide if our rules about
behaviour have been broken. If the behavioural rules have been broken, the
University will decide what action to take. We will inform you of the outcome.
If we think the safety of our community is at risk, we may need to report the
matter to the university or the police. If you are under 18 and have been
sexually assaulted, we must report the matter to the police. It's the law. In
other cases, you can decide if you want to report the matter to the police.
The police will investigate whether the law has been broken. This would be
separate to any university investigation. We will support you and work with
the police to make sure our actions don't interfere with their investigation.
If you are an international student, reporting to the University or the police
will not affect your visa. Reach out to Safer Community for support. Contact
us, safer community at RMIT dot EDU dot AU.

### Prevention and Respect at RMIT
At RMIT, we believe everyone should feel safe, respected and valued in their
place of study and work. Since 2016 we have strengthened our commitment and
action to this and to working nationally with other higher education
institutions to tackle the challenges that impact our progress.
We have a dedicated prevention and respect team that works across the whole of

that contribute to gender-based violence, sexual harassment, harm and assault.
