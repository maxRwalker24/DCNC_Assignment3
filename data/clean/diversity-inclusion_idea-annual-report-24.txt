“RMIT is committed to cultivating inclusive environments
where our academics, researchers more broadly,
professional staff and Higher Degree by Research
candidates feel supported and equipped to excel.
Through the IDEA Framework, we’re further embedding
equity and accessibility into our culture, ensuring that
diverse perspectives are valued and empowered to lead.
By fostering inclusive communities, we enable our
people to generate, disseminate and apply knowledge
that makes a real and lasting impact on society.”
“We strive to foster inclusive campus environments where
everyone who chooses to study or teach at RMIT can participate
without barriers. The IDEA Framework encourages us all to think
about how inclusive practice can be embedded, from individual
actions to systemic change. It’s about valuing diverse thoughts,
perspectives and experiences because when inclusion is
fundamental, success is universal.”
“Creating an inclusive RMIT starts with empowering
our people. Through the IDEA Framework, we’re
embedding inclusive practices into every stage of the
staff experience, from recruitment and onboarding to
professional development and leadership. Our goal is
to ensure that every staff member feels respected,
supported, and able to thrive. Inclusion isn’t just one of
our values, it’s how we work, lead, and grow together.” Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Innovation and
Vice-President, People and Culture

From Self-Doubt to Success:Empowering Students
Claire Brown’s story is a testament to the transformative power of RMIT’s IDEA
Framework and its focus on inclusion. Initially unsure about attending university,
Claire’s experiences at the Student Equity I Belong camp for aspiring Indigenous
secondary school students changed her perspective.
Growing up in a regional Victorian town, Claire faced self-doubt. The I Belong
program exposed Claire to university life and potential career paths, igniting her
passion for education. “I’ve always been into sport, but the energy from the
RMIT student teachers was incredible, I had a huge smile on my face the whole
time,” she recalled. This experience inspired Claire to pursue a Bachelor of
Education (Primary) at RMIT.
Reﬂecting on her ﬁrst year, Claire described it as life changing. “Moving away
from everything I’ve ever known to create a better life for myself has been
amazing,” she said. Now thriving in her studies, Claire works to inspire other
young people like herself to believe in their potential and consider university as a
viable path. New T argeted Pr ograms: Developed

Reﬂecting on the scholarship's impact, Amy stated, “Honestly, I felt incredibly
relieved because I was stressing about how I would be able to ﬁnancially support
myself during my upcoming placement.” She expressed deep gratitude towards the
Foundation for making her educational pursuits more accessible.
Dylan Alcott AO highlighted the program’s goal of creating equal educational
opportunities and fostering a sense of community within the university environment.
“The university experience offers so much more than just study and qualiﬁcations—
it’s about being part of a community, meeting new people, sharing ideas, and
testing your thoughts in a broader context,” he said.

Wear It Purple Day Spotlight
RMIT University marked an historic milestone during
Wear It Purple Day 2024, hosting its ﬁrst-ever
on-campus Pride March along Bowen Street at the CBD
Campus. The annual celebration champions LGBTIQA+
youth visibility and empowerment, bringing together
students and staff in a colourful display of solidarity.
Marchers paraded with pride down Bowen Street,
culminating in a meaningful ceremony at the campus
ﬂagpoles where the Inclusive Pride Flag was raised high
above the University grounds. The day's festivities
extended beyond the march to include engaging Queer
Trivia sessions and the visually striking Purple Pride
fashion and photography exhibition.
Greg Dennis, IDEA Coordinator said Wear It Purple Day
is an incredible opportunity to come together as a
community and show support for LGBTIQA+ youth.
“This year’s theme 'Pride and Passion' resonates
with me and RMIT, highlighting the work we have
done in this space,” he said.
“I'll be wearing purple on the day to increase
visibility of our LGBTIQA+ community and show that
we are not only celebrating diversity but also
reinforcing our commitment to creating an inclusive
environment where everyone feels safe, respected,
and valued. As a member of the LGBTIQA+

Participants identiﬁed key takeaways from the Symposium including the
effectiveness of embedding UDL as the default approach, the importance of
starting with manageable improvements, and the recognition of diversity as a
strength, especially in educational settings.
Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with attendees energised by the collective

“I had been thinking a lot about accessibility and access to nature. Being out in the wild can
be really healing for a lot of people but is very seldom accessible,” Vigo said. “The
underwater scene and the title ‘we breathe underwater’ is a metaphor for how us disabled
folks learn to live within worlds that are not made for us. We constantly adapt and advocate
for ourselves and our communities to overcome the challenges of living in an ableist world.

Addr essing Barriers to Support for the LGBTIQA+ Community
New research led by RMIT highlights persistent
barriers to accessing life-saving support for the
LGBTIQA+ community . In collaboration with
community organisations Switchboard, Roses in
the Ocean, and the University of Sydney, the
study delved into suicidal thoughts and
behaviours within this community, focusing on
protective factors during distress.
Professor Katherine Johnson, Dean of RMIT’s
School of Global, Urban Social Studies, revealed
a signiﬁcant lack of research on support needs,
especially for those with intersecting identities
such as First Nations people, people of colour,
and people with disabilities. "Understanding the
context in which LGBTIQA+ people attempt to
live afﬁrmatively must be the starting point for
effective policy and services,” she explained.
The study uncovered that many experience
suicidal distress from an early age, often
concealing it due to fears of discrimination, lack
of support, and distrust in the healthcare system.
Johnson emphasised the need for targeted
interventions and developing afﬁrming services,
particularly in rural and remote areas.
“We found family support was vital, but it was not
always available or positive,” she noted. The
research plays a crucial role in crafting tailored,
intersectional support systems for LGBTIQA+
individuals. RMIT’s˜ Social Change Enabling
Impact Platform˜ has funded the translation of
Johnson’s research into training materials.
