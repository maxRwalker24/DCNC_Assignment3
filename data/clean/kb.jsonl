Hi, my name's Sarah and I work at RMIT's Equitable learning Service. I'm here\ntoday to share with you my top five tips for learning, so these are important\nthings you can consider before you start your semester, and this should help\nyou be set up and really enjoy your studies with the adjustments flexibility\nand support in place that you require throughout your program. Tip Number One: Think about how you learn best\nSo it can be helpful sometimes to think about previous learning experience\nthat you've had, for example, through high school or other TAFE or university\ncourses you may have done. What worked for you and what didn't? Did you have\nany adjustments, flexibility or supporting place that you found really\nhelpful? Or were there things that you were missing that could have been\nTip Number Two: Get to know your program\nSo it's really good to do a bit of research into the actual program\nrequirements, how it's set up and what's involved."}
{"doc_id": "diversity-inclusion_Equitable Learning FAQs - RMIT University", "source": "C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\RMIT\\Year 2\\Data Comm\\Assignment 3\\DCNC_Assignment3\\data\\clean\\diversity-inclusion_Equitable Learning FAQs - RMIT University.txt", "title": "diversity-inclusion Equitable Learning FAQs - RMIT University", "category": "policy_admin", "passage_index": 15, "text": "So this can include looking\ninto the types of assessments that you may have, for example, is there any\nwork integrated learning placements, internships or external accreditation you\nneed to pass? What do the assessments look like? Are they group assessments,\npresentations, exams or folios? That's really helpful if you know this going\ninto your program so if you meet with the Equitable Learning Service you know\nwhat to expect, where your strengths and weaknesses might be and what\nadjustments could be helpful. Tip Number Three: Get support in place early\nSo the sooner you contact us the better. Our best advice would be to book an\nappointment with the Equitable Learning Service or reach out to us via email\nat the very beginning of semester if not before. This means that we can unpack\nwhat challenges might arise for you, for example, do you get really\noverwhelmed as assessments start to pile up? Or are you concerned about having\nto do a placement or an internship? We can plan with you how you will manage\nthese things."}

If you leave things till the last\nminute it can be really tricky for us to get supports in place for you quickly\nand often it will involve you having to negotiate with teachers, apply for\nspecial consideration and that can cause extra stress. So the more you plan\nahead and the earlier you reach out for support, the better. Tip Number Four: Keep in regular contact with your support team\nSo this might include us the Equitable Learning Service as well as your\nteachers and tutors and perhaps some additional supports such as the Careers\nteam or the Library study supports or mental health supports such as your\ncounsellor and that might be RMIT's counselling service or your own personal\ncounsellor or psychologist and other medical supports who might be able to\nassist through during times of stress or just give you some strategies on how\nto cope up during the studies at RMIT. So the more that we know about what's\ngoing on for you throughout each semester, the more we can help."}

So we recommend\nthat you book an appointment with your health practitioner as soon as you know\nyou're going to need supports during your study and email that back to us so\nthat we have everything saved to your confidential student file and can then\nput some adjustments in place for you. Some students don't have a regular GP\nor health practitioner that they can see so please let us know if this is the\ncase and we can help with referrals or you could also book in at the RMIT\nMedical Hub which is a really great starting point."}

RMIT recognises that a person’s sex and gender may not necessarily be the same. Some people\nmay identify as a different gender to the one assigned at birth, and some people may identify as\nneither exclusively male nor exclusively female. ‘Gender affirmation ’ refers to the time when a person commences living and behaving as a\nmember of another gender other than their gender or sex assigned at birth. This may also be\nknown as ‘gender transition’ or ‘transitioning’ but gender affirmation is the recommended language.

Be respectful of people’s pronouns. If in doubt, ask them privately. Pronouns might include (but\nare not limited to):\n• he/him/his\n• she/her/hers\n• they/them/theirs\nSome people may use a combination of the above that affirm s their gender identity. 5.2 Acronyms and preferred language\nYou have probably seen variations of LGBT, GLBTI, LGBTIQ used to describe lesbian, gay, bisexual,\ntrans, intersex and queer people and communities. There are many arguments for and against the\nuse of such acronyms, but it is generally agreed that most variati ons do not represent the full\nspectrum of sexuality and gender identity. Inclusive language continues to evolve over time as people find the language that best suits their\nidentity and experience. For example, some older documents use terms such as ‘sexual preference’ and ‘lifestyle choice’\nwhen referring to the LGBTIQA+ community."}

The opportunity for students to undertake WIL is a cornerstone of RMIT University’s approach to industry relevant education and is central to the student experience. All students, including those who are part of the LGBTIQA+ community, are supported to undertake WIL that is relevant for their chosen program of study. Regardless of if they are LGBTQIA+ or not, students undertaking WIL are encouraged to familiarise themselves with this guide to prepare for a WIL experience where you may meet or work with colleagues, employers, communities, and customers who are part of the LGBTIQA+ community.

This means having access to the same educational opportunities and choices as all other students, including opportunities to participate in WIL as well providing the resources to non LGBTIQA+ people to act as an ally whilst undertaking WIL alongside LGBTIQA+ individuals and communities. 2. Planning for WIL While gender identity, sex and sexuality are protected attributes by Australian law, workplaces are still reporting that, while overt racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia are not as prevalent as they were many years ago, workplaces are still challenging environments for many LGBTIQA+ individuals. WIL is an opportunity to gain new experiences, learn new skills and expand knowledge."}

Some things you might want to investigate before undertaking WIL: • Visibility of LGBTIQA+ identities within the organisation’s public profile • Is there an ally network or equivalent? • Signaling of allyship (e.g. pronouns in email signature, rainbow lanyards) • Is there support for using a chosen (non-legal) name in systems? • Gender neutral facilities and uniform/dress code policies • LGBTIQA+ training and resources."}

Support for LGBTIQA+ students: At RMIT we recognise that supporting the LGBTIQA+ community can require a broader understanding of allyship. This guide complements other resources to support the student LGBTIQA+ community. To find out more about the support offered for both students and staff, visit RMIT’s LGBTIQA+ website. https://www.rmit.edu.au/staff/our-rmit/ diversity-inclusion/lgbtiqa who can help you with anything from writing an email to joining meetings with you. For more information, contact your Course Coordinator, WIL Champion, or the WIL administration team in your School. 5. Changes to your WIL Activity There are several reasons why you may want to request some changes to your WIL activity."}

Changes can be requested following a discussion between you and your WIL Practitioner (in most cases your Course Coordinator) and the partner organisation. The WIL Practitioner can facilitate a WIL Activity Planning Meeting with you and/or share details of the recommended changes through email communication. This meeting offers an opportunity for all parties to discuss required changes."}

Disclosure and confidentiality To implement changes to your WIL activity, the University requires written content to discuss the nature of the requested changes with the partner organisation. You are under no obligation to disclose your LGBTIQA+ identity/status to anyone. If you decide to disclose to the WIL Practitioner in order to discuss the impact of your LGBTIQA+ identity/ status on a WIL activity, this information cannot be released to partner organisations without written consent.

What to do if things go wrong during WIL Despite planning and implementation of changes, it is possible that you may still encounter challenges or feel unsafe during WIL. In such cases the following options can be considered: • Discontinue WIL activity • Defer WIL activity • Request further adjustments to support completion of WIL e.g. change WIL location to one with gender neutral facilities. When considering what option to pursue, the following questions should be considered: • What is the impediment to completing the WIL activity? • Can further changes address this impediment? When a WIL activity is discontinued, you will be provided with an opportunity to develop a plan for completion in collaboration with the WIL Practitioner."}

If you don’t do the WIL placement or activity assessment, you will need to repeat, in the same way you would if you missed an exam (note: all Special Consideration processes apply)."}
